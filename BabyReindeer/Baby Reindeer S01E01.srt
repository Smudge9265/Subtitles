1
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,320
- 需要帮忙吗? - 对
- Can I help you? - Uh, yeah. Um...

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,400
我想报案 流程是怎样的?
I would like to report something. How does it work?

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,920
你想报什么案?
What would you like to report?

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,200
我不知道该怎么跟你说 但我被人跟踪了
I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm, like, I'm getting stalked.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,400
- 男人还是女人? - 一个女人
- By a man or a woman? - A woman.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,480
你们有过性关系吗?
Have you had a sexual relationship with this woman?

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,640
没有 她年纪比我大
No, I... I haven't. She's a bit older than me.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,200
年龄通常不是我们考虑的因素
Age is generally not a factor we consider.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,880
不 当然 但我可以保证 绝对没有跟她发生过关系
No, of course. I can assure you, though, I... I absolutely haven't.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,120
好吧 你说这个女人在跟踪你?
Okay. You say this woman's stalking you?

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,600
对 她总去我工作的地方、去我家
Yeah. She comes to my work. She comes to my house.

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,200
而且一直给我发邮件
She sends me emails, like... like all the time.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,640
内容有威胁性吗?
Are any threatening towards ya?

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,480
喔 绝对有 我随便找一封出来给你看 这个
Oh, I'm sure. I mean... I mean, let me just open up a random one. Here.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,840
{\an8}我刚吃了一个蛋

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,440
我不认为这具有任何威胁性
I wouldn't say that's particularly threatening.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,160
她真的发过有威胁性的邮件
They're... they're in here somewhere.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,720
只是我得把它们筛选出来...
I just need to sift through all of the...

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,480
听着 我真的很担心
Look, I'm... I'm really worried here.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,360
我觉得她需要帮助
I think she needs help.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,120
这种情况持续多久了?
How long has it been going on?

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,680
我没算过
I don't know, like...

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,080
大概六个月吧
six months, maybe.

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,620
六个月?
Six months?!

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,940
那你为什么现在才来报案?
Why'd it take you so long to report it?

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,160
{\an8}这是一个真实的故事

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,600
起初我为她感到难过
I felt sorry for her.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,840
那是我第一眼的直觉
That's the first feeling I felt.

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,000
可怜一个初次见到的人
It's a patronizing, arrogant feeling,

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,280
这种想法未免有些自大和高高在上
feeling sorry for someone you've only just laid eyes on,

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,840
但我真是这么想的 我为她感到难过
but I did. I felt sorry for her.

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,600
- 去招呼客人 傻冒 - 好 抱歉
- Serve, you twat. - Yep. Sorry.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,120
五英镑 谢谢
Fiver, please, mate.

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,920
- 谢了 伙计 谢谢 - 多谢
- Cheers, mate. Thank you. - Thanks.

37
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,640
- 您想要点什么吗? - 不了 谢谢
- Can I get you something? - No, thanks.

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
您确定吗?
Are you sure?

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,520
- 喝杯茶? - 不用了 谢谢
- Cup of tea? - No, thanks.

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,480
- 要坐在店里 您得消费 - 我什么也买不起
- You have to buy something. - Can't afford something.

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,600
- 是吗 连一杯茶也买不起? - 对
- Right. Not even a cup of tea? - No.

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,120
好吧 那...
Right, well...

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,520
要不我免费给您一杯茶吧
How about I give you a cup of tea on the house?

46
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,600
好的
All right.

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,560
- 你是做什么工作的? - 我是律师
- So, what do you do? - I'm a lawyer.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,520
你是怎么当上律师的?
How'd you get into that, then?

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,080
我接受过刑法培训
I trained in criminal law,

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,880
后来我搬去了英格兰 再次受训后开办了自己的律所
moved to England, retrained, opened up my own practice,

52
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,920
赢得了几个奖项 现在是政府的一名首席顾问
won several awards, now a leading advisor to the government.

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,440
- 你有自己的律所? - 不止
- You own a law firm? - Amongst other things.

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,280
我有三套公寓 皮姆利科那套能俯瞰私人花园
A flat in Pimlico overlooking a private garden,

55
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,080
贝克斯利希斯一套 贝尔塞斯公园两套
one in Bexleyheath, two in Belsize Park.

56
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,680
上帝不喜人炫耀
God doesn't like a bragger,

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,120
但身为顶级政客的首席法律顾问
but when you're the go-to for the biggest political minds,

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,360
自然有资格炫耀
you've earned a brag or two.

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,320
不 我不会告诉你 客户的名字 所以别问
No, no, I'm not gonna say who, so don't even go there.

60
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,400
好吧
Fine!

61
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,640
戴维·卡梅伦、尼克·克莱格 亚历克斯·萨尔蒙德 但你当我没说
David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Alex Salmond. But you didn't hear that from me.

62
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,280
{\an8}奈杰尔·法拉奇 托尼·布莱尔

63
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,320
哇 那你一定参加过很高端的晚宴吧
Wow. You must have amazing dinner parties.

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,320
她的笑声很不可思议 如此飘飘然 又有点令人不安
She had this incredible laugh. This giddy, slightly disconcerting laugh.

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,520
- 她的名字叫... - 玛莎
- Her name was... - Martha.

66
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,720
但我满脑子只想着 若这些都是真的
But all I could think was, if all of this is true,

67
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,760
你怎么会连杯茶都买不起?
then why can't you afford a cup of tea?

68
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,560
{\an8}我许要一个好男孩莱照顾我 他要长得像只驯鹿宝贝一样

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,400
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

70
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,400
{\an8}驯鹿宝贝

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,840
我搬到伦敦是为了 实现毕生的梦想 成为一名谐星
I'd moved to London to fulfil my lifelong dream of becoming a comedian,

73
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,960
但不知怎地 我年近三十 却仍干着毫无晋升空间的工作
but for whatever reason found myself late twenties, working a dead-end job

74
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,360
免费住在前女友的妈妈
and living rent-free with my ex-girlfriend's mother

75
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,680
位于偏远郊区的大房子里
in a massive house miles out of town.

76
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,880
初来乍到时 我怀揣着雄心壮志
I had arrived with such grand plans to be someone,

77
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,320
仿佛我这些一塌糊涂的滑稽笑料
as though my brand of wacky, bullshit comedy

78
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,160
正是这座国际大都市缺少的奇思妙想
was exactly what this world-leading city was missing.

79
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,760
我最近改吃素了
So I went vegan recently.

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,720
不得不做出些牺牲
Had to make some sacrifices.

81
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,480
这是貂皮帽
It's a mink hat.

82
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,720
但它不是用貂皮做的 而是一顶寻常帽子上订了只貂
But instead of actual mink, it's a mink stapled to a hat.

83
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,640
你弱爆了
You're shite!

85
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,520
见鬼
Fucking hell.

86
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,920
但伦敦就是这样 它不会张开双臂迎接任何人
But that's the thing with London. It red-carpets for no one.

87
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,000
感觉就像某天醒来 忽然发现自己只是茫茫人海中
It's like waking up one day to find yourself a background artist

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,800
一个渺小的背景板
in a cast of millions.

89
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,280
所以当有人透过那现实的泥潭
So when someone sees you through the mire of it all,

90
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,240
看到了你梦想成为的自己
sees you as the person you came here to be,

91
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
你自然会注意到她
you notice them.

92
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,960
你会注意到她看到了你
You notice them noticing you.

94
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,360
现在玛莎每天都会来店里
Every day now, Martha would come in,

95
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,040
每次都会换上全新的妆容和发型 如同在玩装扮游戏的孩子
each time with new makeup, new hairstyles, like a kid playing dress-up.

96
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,960
她的开场白总是...
She always opened the conversation by saying...

97
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,040
我很快就得走了
I've gotta go.

98
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,640
...但却总会一直待到我下班
...but then would stick around for the entire shift.

99
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,720
我认为她此举很奇怪 把自己粉饰成一个大忙人
I always thought it was strange that she painted herself as a busy person,

100
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,240
好像这样我就不会看穿 
as though she could trick me

101
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,840
她其实根本无所事事
into thinking she's not spending all of her time hanging around.

102
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,200
今天很忙 有年度股东大会和股东会议要赶
Got a busy day today. AGMs, shareholder meets.

103
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,960
然后还得去理发 所以我不能聊太久
Then I'm getting my hair buffed, so can't chat long.

104
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,320
她每次都点同样的饮料 一杯...
She always ordered the same drink every time. A...

105
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,960
健怡可乐 多加冰
Diet Coke. Plenty ice.

106
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,760
我总是免费供应
I always gave it to her on the house.

107
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,080
- 但她从来不喝 - 我在代表一些大客户...
- She never drank her drink. - I'm representing big clients...

108
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,360
只是机械性地坐在那里
Instead, she would sit there on autopilot,

109
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,560
滔滔不绝地谈论她生活中的大人物 
monologuing breathlessly about people in her life

110
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,360
但从来不说他们究竟是谁
without ever explaining who they were.

111
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,760
我先前在跟史蒂夫聊天
I was talking to Steve earlier.

112
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,920
我刚才在跟朱恩聊天 先前在跟艾伦通电话
I was chatting to Joan. Alan was on the phone.

113
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,960
就像我早知道这些人是谁 我是她的老熟人似的
Like I knew them already. Like I was already a part of her life.

114
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,000
当她不谈论那些人
And when she wasn't speaking about them

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,120
或者她的律所和她认识的大名人时
or her law firm or all the famous people she knew,

116
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,800
她会坐在那里谈论我
she would sit there talking about me.

117
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,080
你的手很有男子气概呢
You've got really manly hands, haven't you?

118
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,000
- 是吗? - 浑厚深沉的嗓音 轮廓分明的下颌线
- Oh yeah? - Big, deep voice. Chiseled jawline.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,400
你这样完美的骨相简直违法嘛
Should be illegal to have your bone structure too.

120
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,760
他们真该向你收税 男人税
They should tax you for it. Man tax.

121
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,440
她的一切都让我好奇
Everything about her intrigued me.

122
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,520
她那无穷的自信、奇怪的说话方式
Her endless confidence, her weird turn of phrase,

123
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,080
以及在高谈阔论之余 偶尔展露的诗意
the surprising poetry that slipped through the cracks of her madness.

124
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,120
我们一起逃离这城市的喧嚣吧
Shall we run away together?

125
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,440
我的生日快到了 想做点特别的事
My birthday's coming up. Want to do something spesh.

126
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,880
谁说我想逃了?
Who says I wanna run away?

127
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,040
你已经在逃了 有些人想逃避时 会收拾行囊
You're already doing it. Some people run away by packing their bags.

128
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,400
而有些人会在同一个地方 长久地裹足不前
Others run away by standing in the same place for too long.

129
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,760
抱歉
Sorry.

130
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,240
我今早起来就感觉不对劲 不知道我这是怎么了
Woke up a little gravy this morning. Not sure what's come over me.

131
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,040
在她最脆弱的时刻 我会看着她
Then I would look at her in her most vulnerable moments,

132
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,200
开始重新想象她的过去
and I would start to reimagine her past.

133
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,920
没人邀请她去学校舞会
The school balls that no one took her to.

134
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,360
她自娱自乐 无数次地试穿婚纱
The time she tried on wedding dresses for fun.

135
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,400
以及许多个夜晚
Nights lost on social media 

136
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,000
她沉浸在社交媒体上 浏览富人和名流的生活
perusing the lives of the rich and famous.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,160
不知我当时是怎么想的 竟开始鬼使神差地赞美她
So I don't know what it was in me, but I started paying her compliments.

138
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,240
你的生日快到了 21岁生日吗?
Your birthday's coming up. Your 21st, is it?

139
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,400
我都42岁了
I'm 42!

140
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,840
四十二? 完全看不出来 你是冻龄女神吗?
You're 42? Well, you'd better give Peter Pan his moisturizer back.

142
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,880
天哪
My oh my!

143
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,480
你这小嘴是抹了蜜吗? 淘气鬼
You've got a silver tongue on you, you do, devil boy.

144
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,800
我可以教你用它做更妙的事情
Wouldn't mind teaching you where to put it.

145
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,560
这周末一起去野餐吧? 为我庆生
What do you say to picnic fun times this weekend to celebrate?

146
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,760
艳阳高照 花粉量也低
The sun's out. Pollen count's low.

147
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,080
你可以做个天然美黑 还不用担心过敏
You can get a tan without getting the sniffles.

148
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,320
好啊 我和你去野餐
Sure, I'll come picnic with you.

149
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,800
天啊
Oh my!

150
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,960
和我最喜欢的驯鹿宝贝一起野餐
Picnic fun times with my favorite reindeer.

151
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,880
把手机号给我 我们好一起筹划
Give me your number. We can arrange.

152
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,680
这样吧
Tell you what,

153
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,760
告诉我时间和地点 我们到时候见
name the time and the place, and I'll get you there.

154
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
我会站在那个美丽的黑发女郎身边
I'll be the one next to the gorgeous brunette.

155
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
哪个黑发女郎?
Who's that, then?

156
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,320
噢 你是说我吗?
Oh! You mean me?

157
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
我开始爱上了她的笑声 我迷恋那声音
I began to love her laugh, obsess with it,

158
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,600
以至不遗余力地逗她开心
do everything I could to eke it out of her.

159
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,520
都是些随意 无害的俏皮话
It was casual. It was harmless.

160
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,920
但我们的关系逐渐成了酒吧里的谈资
It was becoming a joke around the bar.

161
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,440
喂 唐尼 你不给我们介绍一下你女朋友吗?
Oi, Donny. Aren't you gonna introduce us to your girlfriend?

162
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,080
这就是你一直跟我们说的美女?
So is this the one you've been telling us about?

163
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,480
- 那个超模? - 你说我是超模? 真的吗?
- The supermodel? - You said that? Really?

165
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,960
拜托 唐尼 别藏着掖着了 你们俩打算什么时候上床?
Yeah, so come on, Donny. Out with it. When are you two gonna shag?

167
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
我不认同婚前性行为
Ah, don't believe in sex before marriage.

169
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,520
那你还等什么?
What you waiting for?

170
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,680
求婚啊
Ask her.

171
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,280
对呀 求婚
Yeah. Ask her!

172
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,160
求婚
Ask her! ...

173
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,560
怎么 开不了口吗?
What, you not asking?

174
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,280
我会是个好老婆哦
I'm marriage material.

175
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,440
光一半财产就够你暴富了
Half of everything makes you rich.

176
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,720
刚买了一套顶层公寓 家具齐全的
Just bought a penthouse. Furnished.

177
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,600
现在就差一个人帮我挂窗帘了
All I need now is for someone to hang my curtains.

178
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,400
"帮她挂窗帘"
"Hang her curtains."

179
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,960
不知怎地听起来有点色情
Something about it sounded vaguely sexual.

180
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
我讨厌把自己拉低到跟他们同一水平
I hated lowering myself to their level,

181
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,560
但我需要化解这令人尴尬至极的局面
but I needed a way out of that painfully awkward situation.

182
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,600
好啊 那我就满足你的需求
I'll hang your curtains!

183
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,280
我想逗她笑
I wanted her to laugh.

184
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,120
我希望她对这个玩笑 一笑了之 但她没有
I wanted her to share in the joke, but she just didn't.

185
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,640
那一刻 我意识到
I knew then, in that moment,

186
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,440
她把那句话当真了
that she'd taken it seriously.

187
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,120
{\an8}驯鹿宝贝 玫瑰太俗套了 你要响些有创意的点子追我

188
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,280
{\an8}我能一口气高潮好几次哦

189
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,160
{\an8}我回教你各种手上工夫

190
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,280
{\an8}我得走了 -小玛

191
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,480
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

192
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,240
然后我开始收到她的邮件
Then came her emails,

193
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,120
一天差不多80封 从早发到晚
around 80 a day, continuing long into the night.

194
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,200
{\an8}垃圾邮件

195
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,200
她的账户名跟垃圾邮件一样 是一串随机组合的数字和字母
Her address, a random series of numbers and letters, like spam,

196
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,920
但内容跟她的说话风格如出一辙
but the writing, exactly like she spoke.

197
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,040
不经大脑、直白露骨
Unhesitating, unfiltered.

198
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,680
恬不知耻地赤裸裸
Unapologetically raw.

199
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,680
有很多简单的字都写错了 而一些复杂的字
There were spelling errors on words much simpler to spell

200
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,720
却都能写对
than other words she spelled perfectly.

201
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,760
原来她有一部苹果手机
The fact she has an iPhone,

202
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,680
但我在酒吧 从来没见过她用苹果手机发短信
even though she didn't when I saw her texting at the bar.

203
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,280
看我带来了什么 小驯鹿
Look what I got, reindeer,

204
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,960
为我们的快乐野餐准备的
ahead of picnic fun times.

205
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,800
嗒哒 一个小食篮
Ta-da! A wee-willie hamper.

207
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,760
里面有果酱、橘子酱
It's got jam and marmalade,

208
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,680
香煎面包块
croutons,

209
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,280
还有香槟呢 如果你爱喝酒的话
and champagne, too, if that's your tipple.

210
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,600
我不喝酒 但我不介意你把它
I don't drink myself, but you're absolutely welcome

211
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,880
倒在我的胸上舔舐享用
to pour it on my chest and lick it from me.

212
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
{\an8}经典食篮 195.5英镑

213
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
怎么了?
What's the matter?

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,240
没什么 只是你未免太破费了吧
No, nothing. It's just you've... you've spent quite a lot here.

215
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,480
今年的生日很特别
Well, it's a special birthday this year.

216
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,000
是我的43岁生日呢
My 43rd, no less.

217
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,240
而且可以和你一起度过
And I get to spend it with you.

218
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,120
玛莎 我觉得这不是一个好主意
Martha, I think maybe this isn't such a great idea.

219
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,880
什么? 你不想野餐了吗?
What? No picnic fun times?

220
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,080
对 我不想去
No, I... I don't think so.

221
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,200
真的吗? 为什么? 我刚还去买了一床被单呢
Really? Why? I've just gone and bought a quilt too.

222
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,920
很柔软的 这样你躺在草地上就不会长疹子了
It's extra soft so you don't get pimples from the grass.

224
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,640
说到野餐 应该是情侣才会一起做的事吧?
Well, picnics, that's... that's kind of what lovers do, you know?

226
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,440
那朋友会做什么?
Well, what do friends do?

228
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,560
- 不知道 喝杯咖啡之类的吧 - 咖啡很好呀
- I don't know. A coffee or something. - Coffee's good.

230
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,240
{\an8}咖啡欢乐时光 耶

231
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,480
{\an8}我叉点就给你买丁字裤了 但转念一响 我又不是小女生

232
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,680
{\an8}不需要那玩意莱调情 狠狠干我吧!

233
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,400
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

234
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,720
{\an8}全天菜单

235
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,920
- 你想好要吃什么了吗? - 我想要苏格兰浓汤
- Do you know what you're having? - Well, I want the Scotch broth.

236
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,760
不知道有没有戏
Trying to figure out if it's on the menu or not.

238
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,240
我在菜单上没看...
I don't see it on the m--

240
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
一语双关啊 厉害
Oh. Very good.

241
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,600
所以呢? 有戏吗?
Well? Is it on the menu?

242
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,440
很遗憾 没有
Uh, no, I'm afraid not.

243
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,720
不过今日特供可以有
You'll find it in the specials though.

244
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,360
今日特供
The specials.
 
246
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,280
你笑得好夸张
that is some laugh.

247
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,000
是啊 大家总这么说
Yeah, I get that all the time.

248
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,240
笑笑妞 我爸以前总这么叫我
Chuckles Buckles, my dad used to call me.

249
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,840
他那双手可大了
With his big hands.

250
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,360
好吧 笑笑妞 你有音量旋钮吗? 能不能调低一点?
Well, do you have a volume dial? Can I turn you down a bit?

251
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,000
那你得先让我性奋起来
You'd have to turn me on first.

252
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,800
你对我是认真的吗?
So, are you serious about me?

254
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,920
实话实说吧 我能承受
I can take it. Just be honest.

255
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,280
我负责过不少世界级的大案子
I mean, I've overseen some of the biggest cases in the world.

256
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,080
好莱坞、任何你能想到的业界大拿 
Hollywood. You name it.

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,520
我什么都能应付
I can handle anything.

258
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,520
但很遗憾 显然 你那些关于"满足我"的言语
Be a shame though, obviously, what with the... with the curtains,

260
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,120
勾起了我的期待
getting my hopes up.

261
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,720
但我会收拾好心情的
But I'd work through it.

262
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
我会想办法释怀
I'd work through it.

264
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,280
我对你是认真的
Yes, I'm... I'm... I'm serious about you.

266
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,720
不 别叫唤 天哪
No, don't! Oh my God.

267
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,080
慢着 是朋友 好吗?  我把你当朋友
Wait. As a friend, okay? As a friend.

268
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,120
朋友
Friends

269
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,120
会上床的那种
with benefits.

270
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,480
只是普通朋友
Just friends.

271
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,840
- 请问你们要点餐吗? - 是的
- Can I get you guys anything? - Uh, yeah.

272
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,960
- 我要一杯美式咖啡 谢谢 - 好
- I'll have an Americano, please. - Yep.

273
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,280
- 给我一杯自来水就好 - 当然
- I'll just have a tap water. Sure.

274
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,680
- 你什么都不吃? - 我吃不起
- Uh, you're not having anything? - I can't afford it.

275
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,760
我给你买单 就...
I'll get it. Just...

276
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,160
好
Oh. Okay.

277
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,320
我要一份羊角面包、一份燕麦甜饼
Uh, can I have a croissant, a flapjack,

278
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,000
一个巧克力布朗尼和一杯咖啡
and a chocolate brownie and a coffee?

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,680
好的 请问您要哪种咖啡?
Sure. What kind of coffee?

280
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,520
脱因咖啡 好的 我这就去为您取餐 谢谢
Decaf. Perfect. I'll grab those for you now. Thanks.

281
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,960
那个... 你是怎么知道我的邮件地址的?
So, um, how did you get my email?

284
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,800
在你网站上找到的
Oh. Off your website.

285
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,720
你不该把它写上去 随便一个路人甲都能看到
You shouldn't have it on there. Any so-and-so could get it.

286
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,040
- 我开始意识到了 - 所以你是一名谐星?
- Yeah, I'm starting to realize that. - So you're a comedian?

288
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,480
- 算是吧 - 事业进展不顺
- Sort of. - It's not going well.

290
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,560
你是在问我吗?
Is that a question?

291
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,560
不 这种事我看得出来 你的事业不顺
No. I can tell these things. It's not going well.

292
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,240
其实并没有 所以...
That's not true, actually, so--

293
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,920
我在网上看过你的视频了 那些笑话很烂
I saw some of your comedy videos online. I thought they were shite.

294
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,400
- 我现在有进步了 - 用词也更冒犯人了
- Well, I've moved on a bit now. - Offensive too.

295
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,080
- 那叫讽刺 - 拙劣的讽刺
- It's satire. - Thin satire.

296
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,200
不好意思 你是评论家吗?
Sorry, are you a critic?

297
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,640
- 您的餐点 - 谢谢
Here you are. - Oh. Thank you.

298
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,720
听着 玛莎
Listen, Martha.

299
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,120
你能不能答应我 别跟酒吧里的人说
Can you promise me you won't tell anyone at the pub

300
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,640
我网上那些视频的事?
about those online videos?

301
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,280
别闹了 你该感到自豪才对
Stop it! You should be proud.

302
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,680
你在追逐自己的梦想
You're chasing your dreams.

303
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,960
对 不 我明白 只是...
Yeah, no, I get that. It's just...

304
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,760
只是什么?
What is it?

305
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,160
我这辈子都梦想着成为谐星 只是我...
I spent my life dreaming of becoming a comedian. I just...

306
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,600
我没想到这条路这么难走
I didn't realize it was gonna be so fucking hard.

307
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,640
宝剑锋从磨砺出 不是吗?
Hardness can be good though, too, no?

308
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,480
对 我知道 只是...
Yeah, I know. It's just...

309
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,840
我...我以前总认为 追逐梦想终将收获快乐 但是...
I, like... I used to think my dreams would lead to happiness, but...

310
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,760
现在我感觉这二者并不可兼得
now it almost feels like this choice between the two.

311
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,640
有人伤害了你 对吧?
Somebody hurt you, didn't they?

312
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,920
我能看出来
I can tell.

313
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,840
你就像一位战士
You're like a warrior

314
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,320
铠甲上裂开了一道口子
with a chink in the armor.

315
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
像是某种伤痕
Like a wounding of some kind.

316
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,240
那是个女人吗?
Was it a woman?

317
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,880
你失恋了?
A heartbreak?

319
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,600
不 我没事
No, I'm fine.

320
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,680
战士就是这么嘴硬
That's what a warrior would say.

321
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,120
但我看得出来 你的心在流血
But I can see you're bleeding.

322
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,640
你被伤得很深
Deep wounds.

323
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,640
是谁伤害了你?
Who was it?

324
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,120
玛莎 你能放开我的手吗?
Martha, can you let go of my hand now, please?

325
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,760
- 告诉我她的名字 - 玛莎 拜托
- I want names. Martha, please.

326
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,720
名字
Names.

327
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,080
- 玛莎 请你放手 - 名字
- Martha, please. Names.

328
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,680
- 玛莎 求你了 放手 - 你竟敢如此放肆
Martha, please, let go! - Don't! Don't you dare!

329
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,960
一切还好吗?
Is everything all right here?

331
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,480
是的 我们没事
yeah, we're fine.

332
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,600
真的没事
We're... we're fine. Honest.

333
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,640
你们还想要些什么吗?
Can I get you guys anything else, or...

334
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,280
我想买单
Just the bill.

335
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
- 你走哪条路? - 这边
- What way are you walking? - Uh, this way.

336
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,960
我走这边
I'm this way.

337
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,400
谢谢你请我吃布朗尼
Thanks for the brownie.

338
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,520
我知道她不是身家百万的律师
I knew she wasn't a millionaire lawyer,

339
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,360
但她那番疯狂的举动 令我隐隐有些不安
but seeing her madness play out like that left me with this sense of unease.

340
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,480
这女人是谁 她究竟看上了我什么?
Who was this woman, and what did she see in me?

341
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,200
见鬼 可恶
Fuck! Shit!

342
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,080
{\an8}驯鹿宝贝 我发现你在偷看了 小偷窥狂

343
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,120
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

344
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,920
有时我会怀疑 如果那天没有跟踪她
I sometimes question what would have happened had I not followed her,

345
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,320
而是直接回家 
just turned around and went home.

346
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,600
这场噩梦会不会早就结束了
Whether that is where this whole ordeal might have ended.

347
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,280
也许内心深处 我想被发现
Maybe some part of me wanted to get caught.

348
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,760
也许内心深处 我想看事情会发展成什么样
Maybe some part of me wanted to see where it all might take me.

349
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,800
好的 各位 到目前为止 本场比赛真是精彩纷呈
Okay, guys, it's been a fantastic competition so far.

Okay! Good. All right, let me just quickly chuck this down.

355
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,320
做好演出的准备
Ooh. Set up the gig.

356
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,640
拉开这旧行李箱的拉链
Just unzip the old bagarooney.

357

我知道你们在想什么
Now, I know what you're thinking.

362
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,920
男版维纳斯·威廉姆斯放飞自我了
Venus Williams has let herself go.

363
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,680
抱歉 天啊 我说错名字了 抱歉 这是我新想出来的笑料
Oh, sorry. God, no. I said the wrong name. Sorry, it's new material.

364
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,720
容我拿笔记本看看 然后我...
I'll just grab my notebook out, and I'll...

365
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,640
我再重说一遍 好的 那就...找到了
I'll do it again. Okay, let's just... Here it is. Ha.

Okay, cool. That didn't work. Let's move on.

370
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,560
有一位笑了 希望你的快乐能感染在座的其他人
Uh, one laugh. If you could move around the room, that'd be great.

371
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,800
真是去哪都不能带上我妈呀
Jesus, can't take my mum anywhere, eh?

373
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,400

Want to go for a ride back to my home planet?

378

Your home planet? A planet where people find me funnier?

379

贝尔塞斯公园
Belsize Park.

383
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,640
那我很好奇 你说的宇宙飞船是指...
and so, out of interest, when you say your spaceship, you mean...

384
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,880
一辆菲亚特鹏托
A Fiat Punto.

385

我会唱歌 知道吗?
I can sing, you know?

390
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,320
大家不是来这儿听歌的 所以...
Oh, well, people haven't come here for singing, so...

392
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,960
让她唱
let her sing!

393
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,840
- 来吧 让她唱 - 不行
Go on! Let her sing! No.

395
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,360
拜托 让她唱几句
Come on, let her sing! Let her sing!

396
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,120

I would let you sing more, but can't handle you upstaging me.

405
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,200
请大家给玛莎一点掌声 对

409
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,800
其实我一直觉得那首歌很奇怪
 I've always thought that song was really weird, actually.

410
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,880
他们可能真会说出一些很蠢的话
They could have said something really stupid like,

411
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,680
"然后我把气氛全搞砸了 我说了这样的傻话
"Then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like,

'世人误解了希特勒'"
'Hitler was misunderstood.'"

不得不做出些牺牲
Had to make some sacrifices.

415
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,520
因为我交了新女友 她可是货真价实的弹簧鸡 拜托!
Met a new girlfriend. She's a real spring chicken. Come on!

416
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,240

Yep, gives great head. Oh no, no, no, no, no.

417
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,160

How'd you do that?

423

- 什么? - 忽然出现
- What? - Just appear.

谢谢
Thank you.

432
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,760
噢 别谢我
Oh, don't thank me.

433
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
你该感谢自己
Thank yourself.

434
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
感谢你的天赋
Thank your bones.

436
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
听着
Look.

438
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,440
关于昨天我在你家外面的事 
About yesterday, when I was outside.

439
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,000
对不起 我不该跟踪你的
I shouldn't have followed you. I was--

440
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
噢 别傻了
Oh, no, don't be silly.

441
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,000
我才不会气你偷看呢
I don't begrudge you a peep.

442
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,040
下回直接进来吃大餐吧
Just come in for a plate next time.

443
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,320
我会为你献上我的特色菜
I'll cook you my special dish.

444
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,880
你的特色菜是什么?
What's your special dish?

445
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,120
肥美的小穴
Beef curtains.

446
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,560
见鬼
Fucking hell.

447
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,800
你真的很疯 知道吗?
You're utterly mad, aren't you?

450
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,640
如果能拥有超能力 你希望它是什么?
If you had a superpower, what would it be?

452
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,480
我希望能听见人们的心声
I'd wanna know what people were thinking,

453
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,640
那我就不用一直猜测了
rather than just guessing all the time.

454
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,960
什么? 你担心人们觉得你不好吗?
What? Are you worried people think bad of you or something?

455
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,400
不 我担心人们压根不把我放在眼里
No. I'm worried they don't think about me at all.

456
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,000
- 我想要的超能力很奇怪 - 正如我所料
- Mine's weird. - I expect nothing less.

457
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,640
你有没有幻想过
Do you ever, like,

458
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,280
拉开某人的拉链
want to unzip people

459
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,880
爬进他们的身体?
and climb inside them?

461
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,280
我通常不会有这种冲动 没有
Can't say it's an impulse I've had very often, no.

462
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,520
我希望人类在下巴上有拉链
I wish humans had a chin zip.

463
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,840
可以往下一直拉开到肚子上
One that would open all the way to their bellies.

464
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,880
那我就能拉开拉链 舒服地钻进去
I'd just unzip them and tuck myself away.

465
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,560
你这是想拿我当人皮大衣吗?
Is this you asking me for my skin suit?

467
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,360
对 我要把你当连体服穿
Yes, I'd wear you like a onesie.

469
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,640
天哪 依偎在你的身体里 度过一整个冬天
Oh my God. Snuggle away inside you all winter.

470
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,840
那感觉一定很棒
Ah, that'd be nice.

471
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,680
但我会想念饼干的
I'd miss biscuits though.

472
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,080
那这么着吧
Well, um, I tell you what,

473
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,240
写一张单子 列出你喜欢的饼干
give me a list of the ones you like,

474
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,080
我会趁没人注意 时不时地
and every now and again, when nobody's looking,

475
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,200
拉开下巴上的拉链 扔几块饼干进去给你
I'll unzip my chin and pop some biscuits inside for you.

476
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,000
听起来怎么样?
How does that sound?

477
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,880
那就两全其美了 天哪
Best of both worlds! Oh my God.

479
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,920
天啊
Oh my God.
