1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,000
这就是性侵给人留下的印记
That's what abuse does to you, you know?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,680
它把我变成了 一块吸引生活中各种怪胎的磁石
It made me this sticking plaster for all of life's weirdos.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,560
一个血淋淋的伤口 任他们嗅闻
This... open wound for them to sniff at.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,840
我知道她是个疯子 我知道她很危险
I knew she was mad, and I knew she was dangerous,

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,520
但她夸赞了我 那就足够了
but she flattered me. That was enough.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,720
一个观众偷偷录下了我的自白
A random audience member recorded me on the sly

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,680
然后发到了油管上 那个视频一下子就火了
and uploaded the video to YouTube, and it went viral.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,880
不出几周
In a matter of weeks,

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,760
我就从一个透明的边缘人 变成了热点人物
I went from a walking ghost to the center of a media storm.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,440
我感到不知所措 因而几乎没注意到
It was so overwhelming that I almost didn't notice

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,360
玛莎停止了对我的邮件轰炸
that Martha had stopped emailing.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,600
新的工作机会不断涌现 令我应接不暇
Too distracted by all the new work opportunities to take notice.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,360
就像被什么东西附身了一样 一股脑全说了出来
It was like something took over, and I just started coming out with it.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,840
播客、广播节目 更大型的演出 更多的观众
Podcasts, radio shows, bigger gigs, better crowds.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,280
所有人都想见我
Everyone wanted a piece of me,

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,440
一时之间 我的事业开始扶摇直上
and my career sprung into surprising action.

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,640
一切都好像在做梦一样
I honestly couldn't believe it was all happening.

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,040
有生以来第一次 我真正感觉自己正在迈向成功
For the first time in my life, I really felt like I was going somewhere.

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,800
女士们先生们 让我们热情欢迎他登场
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,920
唐尼·邓恩
Donny Dunn!

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,920
如今我的生活肉眼可见地蒸蒸日上
And there is nothing like your life going so visibly well

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,760
这就是对性侵者最好的回击
to let your sexual abuser know,

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,000
"去你的 你毁不了我"
"Fuck you. You failed to break me."

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,080
非常感谢大家
Ah, thank you very much.

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,600
首先 我想对 看过那段视频的朋友们说
Now, for those of you that have seen the viral video,

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,960
别担心 我不会再那样发神经了
don't worry, I'm not gonna go into all that again.

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,760
然而前排有一个人 正用奇怪的眼神看着我
Although there is a guy in the front row looking at me a bit funny.

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,120
能查询一下 这家伙有没有犯罪记录吗?
Is it possible to get a DBS check on this guy, please?

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,440
一时间发生了太多的事 我完全跟不上节奏
I couldn't keep up with it, everything that was happening.

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,440
似乎过往三十年的人生中
It was like my life began three decades in,

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,760
我苦苦追寻的成功 只需要诚实面对自己就能实现
and all I needed to do to achieve it was to be honest with myself.

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,080
我竟歪打正着地找到了出路
It's funny how things work out.

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,560
有时我会忽然情绪失落
And sometimes I would find myself in the free fall of happiness,

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,440
问自己为何把一切憋在心里那么久
and wonder what it was in me that kept it in for so long.

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,880
我以往究竟在害怕些什么
What it was in me that felt so afraid.

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,280
你好
Hello.

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,000
我原本不想再跟你说话的
I wasn't gonna speak to you again,

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,960
但这段时间 我给你在台上说的话做了摘要
but I've been putting down the basics regarding what you said on stage.

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,800
你在视频里说的那些事 你爸妈知道吗?
Do your parents know about all that in the video, yeah?

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,200
那个男人掀开你的衣服 强奸你的事
The shirtlifting, and the guy's cock half hanging out of you.

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,680
我应该告诉他们吗?
I mean, should I tell them?

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,440
他们有权知道自己的儿子 是个丑陋的小基佬
Probably fair to know their son's an ugly little bumboy.

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,680
你说了那么多我的坏话 这点惩罚算轻的了
It's the least you deserve for all those things you said about me.

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,000
对于你的欺骗和伤害 我的愤怒根本无以言表
I cannot express how furious I am about the way you shafted me.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,800
就这样 在最糟糕的时机
And just like that, at the worst possible time,

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,680
在我职业生涯中最重要的时刻
during the most important moment of my professional life,

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,880
玛莎得知了我的手机号码
Martha got my number.

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,640
我怎么会让她知道了我的手机号码?
How the fuck could I let her get my number?

52
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,360
{\an8}驯鹿宝贝 你以为已经摆脱偶了? 

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,480
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,960
{\an8}《驯鹿宝贝》

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,960
第一条新消息
First new message.

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,520
我这段时间没有联系你父母
You know, I've been leaving your parents alone

57
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,480
是因为顾不上
because I didn't have the time for it,

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,040
但我觉得那种事情 他们会有兴趣知道的
but I think they're gonna wanna know information like this.

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,480
我不认为你爸是那种开明的类型
I don't think your dad looks like the accepting type.

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
我不知道玛莎是在吓唬我
I couldn't tell if Martha was bluffing,

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
还是真的会做出 向我家人告密那么恶劣的事
or if she would actually do something as awful as tell my family.

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,560
不管怎样 我好几天没理会她 专心思考应对之策
Either way, I unplugged from her for a few days and made plans.

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,000
我必须赶在她前面向我父母坦白
I just had to get to my parents before she did.

64
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,520
那个 我...
Look, I, um...

65
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,280
不知道你们有没有看过...
I don't know whether you've... seen this...

66
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,120
网上流传的一段我的视频
video of me that's been going around online.

67
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,640
没有 熊宝 我已经不用社交媒体了 而你爸爸...
No, bear, I'm not on social media anymore, and your dad--

68
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,120
不是个白痴
Isn't a fucking moron.

69
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,600
好吧 感谢你的评论
Okay. Thanks for that. Um...

70
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,760
是这样的
Well...

71
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,240
网上有一段视频
it's this video where I, uh...

72
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,560
我在里面坦白了很多事
I confess a lot of things.

73
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,640
我只是...
I just...

74
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,480
我感到很困惑
I just... I feel very confused,

75
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,760
而且 我...
and, um, I...

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,360
其实我也不知道该怎么办才好 但我想努力地
I don't really know anything anymore, but I'm trying to, you know, like,

77
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,080
渡过这个难关
get through it.

78
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,720
我发现我好像不是一个直男
I don't think I'm... I'm straight anymore. Um...

79
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,560
我想我有可能是
I think I'm probably, like,

80
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,120
双性恋
bisexual maybe.

81
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,160
无论如何 这段旅程 它...
It's a journey, anyway, but it's...

82
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,480
我需要你们的支持才能走下去
it's one that I... I need to go on with your support.

83
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,440
过去这几年真的很难熬
These past few years have been really difficult.

84
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,160
现在到你们做选择的时候了
And I think you're gonna have a choice now

85
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,320
你们的儿子可能是双性恋或者同性恋 无论结果如何 你们是愿意接纳我
between a... between a bi son or a... or a gay son, whatever I become,

87
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,920
还是恨不得我干脆自行了断 因为我真的受不了
or a dead one, because I can't handle it anymore.

88
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,720
再把这一切埋在心里了
Keeping it in.

89
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
亲爱的 事情很简单呀
Oh, love, that's easy.

90
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,240
面对这样的选择 我们的答案是毫无疑问的
Giving us a choice like that, there's no question which one we're gonna go for.

91
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,040
拜托 让我说完
Just... Please, just let me finish.

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,000
我在那段视频里 还提到了其他事情
And I sort of speak about... other things in the video too.

93
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,680
我被...
I was, um...

94
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,040
我曾经
I was

95
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,520
被一个男人强奸过
raped by a man.

96
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,880
天啊
Oh my God.

97
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,600
我没事 好吗? 我保证
I'm fine, all right? I promise.

98
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,520
但我在网上那段视频里 提到了这件事 现在所有人都知道了
But I spoke about it in this online video, and now everyone knows.

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,960
我觉得好丢脸
I just feel so fucking embarrassed,

100
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,720
之所以一直瞒着你们
and I guess I never wanted you to know

101
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,520
大概就是怕你们会觉得我...
because I didn't want you to think less of me,

102
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
就是
you know...

103
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,240
...不像个男人吧
...as a man.

104
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
亲爱的 我们怎么会那么想呢?
Oh, darling, of course we don't.

105
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,600
不管发生了任何事 你都是我们的儿子呀
You're our son, whatever happens.

106
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,320
我自己都感觉我不像个男人
I just feel less of one,

107
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,120
居然任由那种事发生在我身上
having let something like that happen to me.

108
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,760
但那种事你也不想的 这不能怪你
But you didn't let it happen. You weren't to blame.

109
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,360
你会觉得我不像个男人吗?
Would you see me as less of one?

110
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,920
什么?
What?

112
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,240
你会觉得我不像个男人吗?
Would you see me as less of a man?

114
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,160
呃 不会
Uh, well, no.

115
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,400
我是在天主教会的环境下长大的
I grew up in the Catholic Church.

116
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,280
抱歉 我...
Uh, sorry, I... I...

117
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,560
我不明白
I don't understand.

118
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,200
天啊 我...
Jesus. I...

119
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,000
我不知道该说什么了
I don't know what to say.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,520
你什么都不用说
You don't have to say anything.

121
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,600
只要知道我们会永远支持你就好
Just know we are always here.

122
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,600
熊宝 我真心疼你
Oh, Bear, I'm so sorry.

123
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,560
那晚我足足睡了12个小时 睡醒后 迎来了一个崭新的黎明
I slept 12 hours that night and woke up to a new dawn.

124
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,440
我有种如释重负的感觉
I felt lighter somehow.

125
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,640
甚至有些惊讶于 忽然就找到了内心的平静
Amazed, even, by the sudden peace I found within myself.

126
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,400
接下来的几天我都待在苏格兰 手机关机 享受平静的生活
I spent the next few days in Scotland with my phone off, enjoying the quiet.

127
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,640
我把发生的一切都告诉了爸妈 泰瑞 玛莎 达瑞安
I told my parents everything. Teri, Martha, Darrien.

128
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
我这辈子从未如此自在过
I hadn't felt so at ease in all my life.

129
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,840
我再也不用害怕了
There was no need to be afraid anymore.

130
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,880
从来都不需要害怕
There was never any need.

131
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,720
踏上返回伦敦的列车那一刻
And by the time I boarded the train back down,

132
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
我真的感觉前路是一片坦途
I really felt like there was nothing in my way.

133
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,400
再没有任何阻碍 当然了 玛莎除外
Nothing, of course, apart from Martha.

136
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,440
祝你和变性人早日复合
Good luck with the transsexual.

137
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,480
好 谢谢你 老爸 只是...谢谢
Yep, thank you, Dad. Just... Thanks.

138
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
你们快回去吧
You can go now.

143
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,040
{\an8}您有新的语音信息 来自未知号码

144
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,480
天啊
Jesus Christ.

145
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,040
欢迎使用语音信箱
Welcome to your voicemail.

146
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,080
您有50条新的消息
You have 50 new messages.

147
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,520
第一条新消息
First new message.

148
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,560
你像个白痴一样站在那里 
You stood there, like a fucking guppy,

149
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,440
在我眼皮子底下聊起那个贱人
wafting that bitch right under my nose,

150
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,200
当众炫耀跟她的奸情
your cock practically in her,

151
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,080
你还指望我怎么样?
and you're expecting me to do what?

152
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,960
她此时此刻还在给我打电话 哪怕我人都在警局了
She's ringing me now, literally, as I stand here.

153
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,400
- 我看见了 邓恩先生 - 那快做点什么啊
- I can see that, Mr. Dunn. - Then do something.

154
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,120
一天之内给人打这么多电话 肯定是违法的吧
You can't ring somebody that many times in a day, surely.

155
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,960
确实 但因为来电的是未知号码
Well, no, you can't, but obviously with unknown numbers,

156
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,600
所以很难证明打电话的是同一个人
it's very difficult to prove who is actually calling.

157
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,400
你的意思是说 我可以给见过的 任何人打电话 打多少次都行
So you're saying I can call anyone I meet as many times as I want,

158
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,600
只要我隐藏自己的号码 就可以为所欲为了?
and as long as I withhold my number, I'm free to do as I please?

159
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,320
你不会真想这么干吧?
You're not planning to?

160
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,640
当然不会
No, I'm not planning to.

161
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,240
我只是在表达一个观点 这种行为应当被制止
I'm making a point. This behavior shouldn't be allowed.

162
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,040
她怎么会知道你的号码?
How'd she get your number anyway?

163
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,560
她之前停止了邮件骚扰 所以我就在邮箱设置了
She'd stopped emailing, so I set an out-of-office,

164
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,440
自动回复... 她肯定是从回复里看到的
and it must have... replied to her.

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
那你想必很难受吧
That's gotta hurt.

167
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,440
辛辛苦苦藏了这么久的电话号码 这么轻易就泄露了
Giving it away so easily after managing to keep it from her for so long.

168
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,160
你现在说这个有用吗?
Why is that helpful?

169
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
那...
Wha-- Uh...

170
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,120
你有试过屏蔽她的电话号码吗?
What about her phone number? Have you tried blocking that?

171
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,680
当然试过了 但陌生号码没法屏蔽
Of course I've tried. You can't block unknown numbers.

172
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,480
这你应该知道的
You should know this.

173
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,120
你就不能去后面 听听她留下的语音信息吗?
Can't you just go into the back and listen to the voicemails she's been leaving?

174
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,120
我们资源有限 听不了那么多语音留言
We can't listen to that many voicemails. We don't have the resources.

175
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,560
天哪 那现在是怎样? 我换个电话号码 向她认输?
Oh my God. So, what? I just change my number and let her win again?

176
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,440
其实 还有一个办法
Well, there is another option.

177
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,520
听着 这是我私下给你的建议
Now, I need to speak off the record here, but

178
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,440
你可以保留现在的号码
it might make sense to keep your number

179
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,320
等她说出某些过激言论 警方就能以之为依据加快调查
and wait for her to say something that we can use to expedite this case.

180
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,360
你是认真的吗?
You're serious?

181
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,760
只是一个建议
Merely a suggestion.

182
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,360
回家去吧 把她出言威胁的时刻统统记录下来
Go home. Mark down moments where she says something threatening.

183
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,760
她每天给你留那么多语音信息
She's leaving you numerous voicemails a day.

184
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,360
里面很可能存在 可以作为查案依据的内容
Chances are there'll be something there we can use.

185
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,360
第一条新消息 我实话跟你说了吧...
First new message. I'm gonna be frank with you...

187
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,600
接下来的几个月
Over the next few months, 

188
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,640
玛莎的语音信息 成了我每日必听的播客
Martha's voicemails became the podcast to my life.

189
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,840
每次搭乘公交和地铁 走在街上赶去与人会面时
I listened to her on every bus ride, every Tube journey,

190
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,680
我都在听她的留言
in the street between meetings.

191
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,840
她的声音时刻萦绕在我耳边
She was there in my ears all the time.

192
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,040
别忘了我也说过要保密
Don't forget what I said about confidentiality.

193
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,360
在那些留言里 她不断追忆往昔
Her voicemails playing out this retrospective

194
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,200
细数着我们相处的点点滴滴
of our entire relationship together.

195
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
你说会满足我的需求时 
When you said about hanging the curtains,

196
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,960
我以为你想玩一夜情
I assumed you had a one-night stand in mind.

197
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,120
桩桩件件 她都记得一清二楚
She remembered everything with such lucidity.

198
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,040
还记得你的那次演出吗? 就是在...
Do you remember that gig you performed at back in the day?

199
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,400
所有闲聊 谈笑
The chats, the laughter.

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,160
以及虚假的承诺
The false promises.

201
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,120
我很震惊 你居然会做出那种事
I'm shocked you did something like that.

202
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,280
简直匪夷所思 她居然会对种种情境
I couldn't believe the meaning she would glean

203
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,000
做出如此不切实际的解读
from the most implausible of places.

205
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,720
那天你为我沦陷了 不是吗? 在运河边那天
You surrendered to me that day, didn't you? By the water.

206
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,920
我开始下载那些语音 将它们进行记录和分类
I started to download them, log and categorize them,

207
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,520
用颜色做标记 按不同的情绪和主题归类
color-code them into different emotions and subjects.

208
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,600
你现在的名气毫无意义 那些人根本不爱你
All this fame means fuck all. They don't love you.

209
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,080
他们总有一天会厌倦的 但我爱你 知道吗?
They'll grow bored. I love you. Yeah?

210
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,720
我开始沉迷其中
It became an obsession.

211
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,840
无视工作方面的来电 取消演出和访谈
I ignored work calls, canceled gigs and interviews,

212
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,760
把时间和精力 都投入在解读玛莎这个谜团
devoted my life to unpacking the mystery of Martha.

213
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,840
她为什么会变成现在这样
Why she was the way that she was.

214
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,320
我不知道自己可曾接近过答案
I'm not sure I ever got close to finding the answer.

215
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,800
你有心理问题 宝贝
You've got psychiatric problems, darling.

216
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,640
事实上 渐渐地 我发现自己又开始与她产生共鸣了
In fact, over time, I found myself relating to her all over again.

217
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,400
我们同样缺乏安全感 对未来感到恐惧
Our shared insecurities, our fears for the future.

218
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,520
夜晚会因同样的烦恼难以入眠
The same things at night which kept us from our sleep.

219
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,680
伦敦有太多喜欢冒充内行 背后捅刀子和刻意欺骗的人了
London's full of charlatans and backstabbers and liars.

220
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,840
她能转移我的注意力 让我不去想自己失去的一切
The way she managed to distract me from all the things that I'd lost.

221
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,120
她威胁过我很多次
She threatened me many times, 

222
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,640
说过很多凶残可怕的话
said stuff that was violent or phobic.

223
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,080
性侵这种事不该是 小男孩和钢琴老师之间的剧情吗?
Isn't abuse for little boys and their piano teachers?

225
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,120
关于我 泰瑞和性侵的都有
About me or Teri or the abuse.

226
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,040
但我仍然选择了无视...
But still, I found myself ignoring it.

227
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,400
最近有什么 需要通报警方的新进展吗?
Has anything new come up that we should know about?

228
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,440
没有
No.

229
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,280
...也许是着了魔 也许是出于空虚 或者内疚 我没有举报她
Holding off reporting her out of fascination or empathy or guilt.

230
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,480
其实那些都是 我不想摆脱她的借口罢了
Any excuse to keep her in my life. 

231
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,400
你敢
Don't you dare!

232
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
有时候 在人生的至暗时刻
And sometimes, in my darkest hours,

233
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,320
我躺在床上彻夜不眠 听着她叙述自己的挣扎...
as I lay awake, listening to how much she was suffering...

234
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,400
每到夜晚 我的心情都很沉重 有时我会无比愤怒
I get heavy at night. I sometimes feel so angry.

235
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,480
气这个世界对我放肆地掠夺
Angry at the world and what it's taken from me.

236
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,200
...我得拼尽全身的力气 才能阻止自己回拨给她
I did have to fight every fiber of my being not to call her back.

237
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,000
所以当我最终决定举报她时
So when I did eventually report her,

238
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,120
仅仅是因为她开始对我家人下手了
I only did it because she started on my family.

239
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,000
仅仅是因为 我感觉无法再承担之后的风险了
I only did it because it felt like a risk I couldn't take any longer.

240
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
新消息
Message.

241
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,320
你和你的家人都装聋作哑 是吧?
So you and your family, you keep your traps shut, yeah?

242
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,840
最后一次警告你 我他妈是认真的
You're on your final warning. I fucking mean it this time.

243
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,440
因为我患上了严重的经前紧张综合征 
Because I've got a raging PMT

244
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,200
有可能拿刀去捅全英国的任何人
where I could just about stab anyone in England, in Britain.

245
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,280
所以你讲话最好小心点 因为没准我哪天就会去捅人
So you'd better watch what you're saying because maybe one day I will stab someone.

246
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,480
玛莎第二天就被捕了
Martha was arrested the next day

247
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
被控三项跟踪和骚扰罪名
and charged with three counts of stalking and harassment.

248
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,120
直到她的认罪听证会日期确定下来
And by the time a date was set for her plea hearing,

249
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,240
我都无法分辨这究竟是 给她的执迷画上了句点 还是给我的
I couldn't tell whether it was putting an end to her fascination or mine.

250
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,760

281
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,600
你好
Hi.

282
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
弗兰西斯给我打了电话
Francis called.

283
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,240
他很担心你
He's concerned about you.

284
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,000
他说你已经窝在房里好几个星期了
He says you've barely come out of your room in weeks.

285
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,840
想进来说吗?
Do you wanna come in?

286
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,600
好啊
Yeah.

287
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,240
这些是什么?
What's all this?

288
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
是关于玛莎的信息
Oh, it's, uh... It's Martha stuff.

289
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,680
- 她不是已经被判刑了吗?  - 判了 但我想理清楚整件事
- I thought she'd been sentenced. - She has. I'm trying to make sense of it.

290
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,880
- 进展如何?  - 就快有答案了
- And how's that going?  - I'm getting closer.

291
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,000
{\an8}我开始对着玛莎的照片手淫

292
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,520
{\an8}切掉他的阴茎或者割了他的舌头

293
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,880
但愿如此 这一切看起来太疯狂了
Yeah, you'd hope so, looking at all this.

294
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,000
是啊 很疯狂
Yeah, it's crazy.

295
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,920
我还保留着当初为了举报她 而下载的所有语音留言
I have all her voicemails from when I downloaded them for the police.

296
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,800
把它们按她的情绪分类 归进了不同的文件夹
I've split them into all these folders capturing her different emotions.

297
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,920
这几周我都在干这个 但还有一大堆没来得及听
I've been doing it for weeks. There's a ton I haven't listened to yet.

298
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,840
有趣的是 像这样把一切铺开来看
It's funny, 'cause when you see them all splayed out like this,

299
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,440
确实能感受到她有多疯魔
you really do get a sense of just how mad she was.

300
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,520
你想坐会儿吗?
Do you wanna sit down or something?

301
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,560
好啊
Yeah.

302
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,840
你看起来很糟糕
You look awful.

303
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,600
我感觉好极了
I feel awesome.

304
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,600
喜剧事业进展如何?
How's the, uh, comedy going?

306
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,560
我已经放弃了
I've given up.

307
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,480
得到了想要的一切 才发现原来那些根本不适合我
Nothing like getting everything you want in life to realize it's not for you.

308
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,080
话说
So, um,

309
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,240
你为什么来找我?
why are you here?

310
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,960
我想请你搬回我妈的房子 整理一下心情
I want you to move back to my mum's place. Sort yourself out a bit.

311
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,880
不行 我在这里签了租约的
I can't. I've signed a lease here. 

312
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,200
别担心 我会替你赔钱
Nah, I'll pay for it.

313
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
搬回去吧
Just move back.

314
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,680
我不能眼看你继续过这样的日子
I can't have you go on living like this.

315
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,920
你已经经历了那么多
Having gone through all of that.

316
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,560
唐尼 那个视频真的让我很生气
That video, Donny, it really upset me.

317
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,080
好吧
Okay.

318
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,440
感觉如何?
How does it feel?

319
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,840
嗯 熟悉的感觉
Yeah, familiar.

320
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,520
那我就不打扰了 有什么需要尽管提
I'll leave you to it. Let me know if you need anything.

321
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,160
谢谢
Thank you.

322
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
对了 我在壁橱里 给你准备了一份小礼物
I forgot to say, I left a little something for you in the cupboard,

323
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,280
还有一些之前整理出来的小物件
along with a couple of bits and bobs I found.

324
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,680
好的 谢谢
Oh, thanks.

325
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,680
{\an8}《刽子手哈利》 作者:唐尼·邓恩

326
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,560
{\an8}这份草稿太棒了 你很有前途 

328
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,840
你好
Hello.

329
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,760
有什么需要我帮忙吗?
Can I help with anything?

330
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,280
对 我在想...
Yeah, I was, uh...

331
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,160
我能不能进去说?
I was wondering if I could come in.

332
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,560
当然
Sure.

333
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,240
想喝杯茶吗?
Would you like a cup of tea?

334
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,120
好啊 劳驾
Yeah, please.

336
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,760
所以他们总是一副嗑嗨的样子?
So they were just high all the time?

337
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,440
天哪 我从来没见过 像他俩那样嗑药的人
Oh my God, I've never seen two people consume drugs like them.

338
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,840
而且还都是私立学校的男生
Private school boys too.

340
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,880
我回家时经常发现 有人在我床上乱搞 太离谱了
I mean, the amount of times I caught people shagging in my bed was insane.

341
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,520
你这段时间去哪了?
Where've you been?

343
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,200
就是到处转转
You know. Here and there.

344
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,560
对不起 我忽然玩失踪
I'm sorry I disappeared.

345
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,520
没关系 我能理解
No. No, I get it.

346
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,880
对了 我看了你的视频
I saw your video, by the way.

347
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,800
是吗?
Oh yeah?

348
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,480
我觉得你很勇敢
I thought it was brave.

349
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,800
非常勇敢
Really brave.

351
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,960
谢谢
Thank you.

352
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,560
你应该回来和我一起工作
You should come back and work with me.

354
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,440
不会再像上次那样了
It won't be like last time.

355
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,800
我不知道 我已经没怎么写东西了
Oh, I... I don't know. I'm sort of not really doing much anymore.

356
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,520
我们正准备翻拍《绵口蛇》
We're bringing Cotton Mouth back for a reboot.

357
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,440
也许现在提这个时机很糟
Probably be terrible, but

358
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,400
但我们正在组建拍摄团队
we're staffing up at this very moment.

359
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,600
你会有薪水
You'd be paid.

360
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,720
我很乐意参与
I'd love that.

361
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,200
{\an8}玛莎的语音留言

362
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,560
{\an8}恭维话

363
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,800
天哪 还有一次在酒吧里
God, and there was this other time in the bar

364
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,320
你穿着白色的紧身内裤在工作 我当时就想
when you were serving in your tight whites, and I thought,

365
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,840
"红色 红色才适合你"
"Red. Red is your color."

366
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,560
然后第二天 你就穿了红色的
And then the next day, you were wearing red.

367
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,920
我觉得你的下颌线很好看 笑起来特别可爱
I think you've got a great jawline, a lovely smile.

368
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,040
就是...我觉得你很有魅力
You know, I think you're, you know, very attractive.

369
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,640
有时候 当你遇到某个人
You know, when you meet someone sometimes,

370
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,240
你会觉得他就是那个对的人
you just think they have it.

371
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,880
而你也对他一见钟情
And you have it.

372
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,080
我不知道 也许是因为喜欢你的说话方式吧
I dunno. Maybe it's your turn of phrase.

373
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,560
好吧 我喜欢你 行了吧? 我喜欢你 好吧 我说出来了
Fine! I fancy you, okay? I fancy you. There, I said it.

374
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,480
天哪 我脸红得 像个十几岁的处女一样
Oh God. I'm blushing like a teenage virgin here.

375
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,480
你好 请给我一杯伏特加可乐
Hi there. - Hi. Yeah, I'll have a vodka Coke, please.

376
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,920
双倍伏特加 谢谢
A... a double. Thanks.

377
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,360
{\an8}没听过的

378
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,240
有件事我一直很好奇
That's the thing I've always wondered.

379
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,840
人们为何会相遇和相爱 诸如此类
Why people meet, why people fall in love, that kind of thing.

380
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,160
也许正因如此 我才会把你当成驯鹿宝贝吧
And I suppose that brings me to the baby reindeer thing.

381
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,440
我想你或许也很疑惑
As I think you're probably wondering.

382
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,920
小时候 我有一个可爱的小毛绒玩具
Basically, I had this wee cuddly toy when I was young.

383
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,760
我去哪儿都带着它
Went with me everywhere.

384
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,280
印象中 最早是从圣诞节开始的
Earliest memory I have, I think, was Christmastime.

385
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,280
有一张我的老照片 我坐在那里 头上戴着纸帽子
This old photo of me, sitting with this paper hat on my head

386
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,000
旁边放着一个驯鹿宝贝
and this baby reindeer beside me.

387
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,560
总之 这只小驯鹿毛茸茸的 超级可爱
Anyway, this reindeer was this cuddly, fluffy thing.

388
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,800
它有厚厚的嘴唇 大大的眼睛
It had big lips, huge eyes,

389
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,520
还有最可爱的小屁股
and the cutest wee bum.

390
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,160
我一直保存到现在呢
I still have it to this day.

391
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,760
它是我整个童年唯一的美好了
It was the only good thing about my childhood.

392
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,520
爸妈吵架的时候
I'd hug it

393
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,640
我就会抱着它
when they fought.

394
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,080
他们经常吵架 知道吗?
And they fought a lot, you know?

395
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,520
你长得就像那只小驯鹿一样
Well, you are the spit of that reindeer.

396
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,000
一样的鼻子
The same nose.

397
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
一样的眼睛
Same eyes.

398
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,120
一样可爱的小屁股
Same cute wee bum.

399
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,000
它对我来说太重要了
It means so much to me.

400
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,920
你...
You...

402
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,720
你对我来说太重要了
You mean so much to me.

403
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,160
我得先挂了
I've gotta go.

404
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,320
你没事吧?
Are you okay? 

405
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,160
没事 抱歉 对 我没事 对不起
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry.

406
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,240
给
Here you go.

407
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,440
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

408
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,720
- 7块2毛5英镑 - 噢 好的
- It's, uh, £7.25. - Oh yeah.

409
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,880
见鬼
Oh fuck.

410
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,240
抱歉 伙计 我好像把钱包落在家里了
Sorry, man, I...I think I've left my wallet at home.

412
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,720
没关系 算我请你的
Don't worry about it. It's on me.

414
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,040
