1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,920
真不敢相信我加了她
I couldn't believe I had done it.

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,520
是一瞬间的疯狂 还是本能地想要自我毁灭?
Was it a moment of madness or an attempt at self-destruction?

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,640
我不确定
I wasn't sure.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,480
我有好几次想删除好友 却又阻止了自己
I went to unfriend her many times, but I always stopped myself.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,120
她是真的有病 还是被人误解 每个故事都有两面
She is ill, misunderstood. There are two sides to every story.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,320
倘若生活本就浑浑噩噩 单凭某个人就能将它彻底摧毁吗?
If you aren't living a life worth living, then can someone ruin it at all?

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,080
然后她开始 在我的所有照片下添加评论
Then came the comments on all my photos,

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,920
有些甚至是我刚注册账户时上传的
some as far back as when I first opened the account.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,680
在我和前女友琪莉的合影旁 发表酸溜溜的评论
Jealous remarks on photos with my ex-girlfriend Keeley,

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,520
还用奇怪的文字描述我的一举一动
alongside these bizarre captions describing my every move.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,680
{\an8}饥渴的小驯鹿

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,840
{\an8}运动小驯鹿

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,200
{\an8}淘气小鹿

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,000
{\an8}开心的小驯鹿

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,680
{\an8}玛莎·史考特

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,200
{\an8}在吗?

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,000
{\an8}今晚太浪漫拉 驯鹿 

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
{\an8}我门算正式交往了吗?

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,920
{\an8}玛莎 那不是约会 那只是...

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,640
{\an8}你岗在打字?怎么停下了?

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,920
{\an8}有人在你傍边吗?

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,560
{\an8}小驯鹿 你根别人在一起吗?

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,680
{\an8}你没有回达我的问题 驯鹿宝贝

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,520
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,640
{\an8}《驯鹿宝贝》

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,880
托尼 不管你在玩什么花样 你成功吸引了我的注意
Well, Tony, whatever you're doing, it's working.

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,280
什么意思?
What do you mean?

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,520
我只是说
I'm just saying,

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,640
我们已经见过六次了
we've met six times now.

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,920
你每次都是讲完一堆笑话就早早离开
All you do is crack jokes then leave early.

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,480
通常女生都会感觉受到了羞辱
A girl should be insulted, 

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,440
但可恨的是 这样反而勾起了我的兴趣
but I hate that it intrigues me.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,400
我喜欢慢慢来 在这方面我是个绅士
Well, I like to take it slow. I'm a gentleman in that respect.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,160
你从不送我去地铁站 不和我谈论你的生活
You never walk me to the Tube. You never tell me about your life.

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
也不用脸书
You're not on Facebook.

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,520
我无从分辨你是否真诚
I can't tell if you're genuine

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,400
会不会哪天我一觉醒来 发现自己被绑架或者谋杀了?
or I'm gonna wake up one day inside a true-crime podcast.

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,040
好吧 你想知道些什么?
Well, what do you wanna know?

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,320
告诉我你为什么总是坚持要来这里
Tell me why you always insist on coming here.

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,640
原因有很多 比如这里氛围好
Well, lots of reasons. Great atmosphere.

45
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,000
是啊 评判一间酒吧的好坏
Yes, you can always judge a great bar

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,240
只要看里面有多少人 在读《金融时报》就够了
by how many people are reading the Financial Times.

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,720
而且这里光线太暗了 我一整晚只能眯缝着眼看你
It's so dark too. I feel all I do is squint at you all evening.

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,480
那就别眯眼 任眼神迷离
Ah, well, don't squint, then. Just let your eyes fuzz.

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,680
我在朦胧的视线中更能进入状态
I really come into my own when I'm in a soft focus.

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
你真的很奇怪
You're so weird.

51
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,320
- 是吗? - 没关系 奇怪很好 我喜欢
- Am I? - It's fine. I like weird.

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,040
或多或少 人人都有各自的古怪 大家都在扮演着正常人
We're all varying degrees of weird, aren't we? Pretending to be human.

53
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,760
说得好 真好 对 我可以借鉴
Ah, that's good, that is. Yeah, I'll use that.

55
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,600
富有哲理的话 在工地上很受欢迎是吗 托尼?
Philosophy go down well on the construction site, does it, Tony?

56
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,640
我是在跨性别交友网站上认识的泰瑞
I met Teri by signing up to a trans dating website.

57
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,080
作为伪装 我把名字从唐尼改成了托尼
I changed my name from Donny to Tony

58
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,160
还虚构了一份工作 把自己包装成另一个人
and invented a job and an entire persona as a means of keeping myself disguised.

59
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,160
我痛恨此等行径
I hated myself for doing it,

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,440
但又实在不想 被人发现我注册了那个网站
but I just couldn't bear the thought of anyone finding out.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
我从没想过会坠入爱河
I never expected to fall in love.

62
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,240
- 你好 - 嘿
- Hi. - Hey.

63
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,440
她聪颖 风趣 有激情 无所顾忌地展现自我
She was brilliant. Fierce, witty, unashamed.

64
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,880
她拥有我所不具备的一切
Everything I was not.

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,600
她是一名治疗师 六年前移居伦敦
A therapist who moved to London six years ago

66
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,920
目前在市中心工作
and was now working in the heart of the city.

67
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,840
随着一次次地聊天 大笑 一起消磨时间到天亮
The more we laughed and chatted and wound down the clock until morning,

68
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,640
我越来越为她着迷
the more and more I fell for her.

69
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,480
当你跟某人说话时
You know something's right

70
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,800
会激动到头皮发麻 便会意识到那是对的人
when you get that tingly feeling behind your eyes when you talk to them.

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,800
可一想到假如跟她约会时 遇见我认识的人
But then I would think about bumping into someone I knew together,

72
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,760
比如酒吧或者喜剧界的人
from the pub or from the comedy world,

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,760
而他们看出来 我在跟一个跨性别女性约会
that they could tell somehow that I was dating a trans woman,

74
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,120
我会羞耻到恨不得找个地缝钻进去
and I just couldn't move past the bullshit of my shame.

75
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,120
所以每次出去约会
So when it came to meeting outside,

76
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,600
我都会把地点约在城市边缘 一间昏暗的鸡尾酒吧
I kept our dates to a dim cocktail bar on the edge of town.

77
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,560
怎么
Well,

78
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
托尼
Tony,

79
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,720
不打算说点什么吗?
are you gonna say something?

80
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,240
我一直想坦白 我其实不叫托尼
I always meant to tell her about Tony,

81
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,920
但我越是喜欢她 就越拖着不敢开口
but the more I fell for her, the more I found myself putting it off.

82
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,280
{\an8}你为什么不回达我的问题?

83
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,240
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

84
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,960
{\an8}发送至泰瑞 昨晚约会很愉快 周五老地方见?

85
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,920
你在这儿呀 弗兰基宝贝
There he is. Frankie, baby.

86
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,160
玛莎
Martha. Um...

88
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,600
- 你好 - 老实说
- Uh, hi.- Honestly, 

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,760
你昨晚去哪儿了? 你不上班的话该告诉我呀
where were you last night? You need to tell me if you're not working.

90
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,400
害我一直担心你会不会 死在了运河里 脸朝下漂在水上
Kept thinking of you floating in that canal somewhere, face down.

91
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,680
就是你走去坐公车时 要经过的那条运河
The one you go through when you walk to the bus from work.

92
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,960
那条路有很多奇怪的人 瘾君子 小偷 什么人都有
All sorts of weird fuckers down that way. Junkies and thieves. All kinds.

93
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
还有很多亚洲人
Asians.

94
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,480
你得小心呀
- You should be careful. - Uh...

95
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,560
天哪 对了 我很喜欢你的脸书页面
Oh my God, been loving your Facebook page by the way.

96
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,400
只是我想不通 你怎么老爱跟那些荡妇瞎混
Don't know what I think of the tarts you surround yourself with.

97
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
尤其是那个琪莉·利赫
That Keeley Leigh one in particular.

98
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,040
她总爱抱着你 把鼻子埋进你的后颈
The way she's always hugging you and burrowing her nose into your nape.

99
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
那女人是有多饥渴呀?
I mean, how desperate can one tart be?

100
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,480
简直难以置信
Can you imagine it?

102
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,480
你在给谁发短信?
So, who are you texting?

103
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,680
- 你说什么? - 不是那个叫琪莉的贱人吧?
- I'm sorry? - Wasn't that Keeley bint, was it?

105
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,480
不是 玛莎 你要真想知道 琪莉只是我的一个老朋友
No, Martha. If you must know, Keeley's just an old friend, okay?

106
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,200
男女之间没有纯粹的友谊
Men and women can't be friends.

107
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,600
你们是炮友?
You fucking her?

108
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,240
什么? 不 玛莎 我们不是 拜托你别纠结这个话题了 好吗?
What? No, Martha, I'm not. Now, will you drop it, please?

109
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,480
天啊 对不起 小驯鹿
Oh my God. I'm sorry, reindeer.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,520
吓着你了吧 我知道 是我太激动了
I'm a nightmare, I know. I was getting carried away with myself.

111
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,760
我只是不太擅长竞争 知道吗?
I'm just not very good with competition, see?

112
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,360
它会害我展现出最坏的一面
Tends to bring out the worst in me.

113
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,640
- 怎么说? - 表现在很多方面
- How so? - Oh, lots of ways, really.

115
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,240
我会沉迷在网上 查找所有关于情敌的信息
I find myself getting lost on the Internet trying to find out everything about them.

116
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,800
不过别担心 小驯鹿 我知道你是单身
But don't worry, reindeer. I know you're single.

117
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,760
你不会在追求我的同时 还跟一个妖艳贱货纠缠不清
You don't sing into a girl's soul like that with a tart on the side.

118
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,600
那样太残忍了
That'd be cruel.

119
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,400
我不会接受的
I wouldn't abide by that.

120
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,560
总之 我们进屋再说吧
Anyway, I'll get you inside.

121
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,160
那晚我失眠了 我害怕玛莎发现泰瑞的事
I couldn't sleep that night for fear of Martha finding out about Teri.

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,640
{\an8}我们换个地方 去这儿吧

123
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,680
到时会怎样?
What would happen then?

124
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,280
我对自己发誓 要尽可能地让她俩保持距离
I made a vow to keep them as far apart as possible.

125
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,800
我以为让泰瑞远离玛莎 会比较容易实现
I figured the easier thing to do would be to keep Teri away from Martha.

126
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,480
嘿 泰瑞
Hey, Teri!

127
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,640
你怎么来了?
What are you doing here?

128
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,400
天啊
Holy shit.

129
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,240
光今天就有几百封邮件
There's, like, hundreds just today.

130
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,720
你全看过吗?
Have you read all these?

131
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,640
没有 一天时间根本看不过来
No, there's not enough time in the day to read all of them.

132
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,120
其中有些内容...
Some of these are...

133
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,040
她显然精神不太正常
I mean, she's clearly unwell.

134
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,720
是啊 所以我认为 我们应该暂时保持低调
Yeah. That's why I think we should lay low for a while.

135
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,240
她为什么叫你唐尼?
Why does she call you Donny?

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,400
她给我起了很多外号
Oh, she... she calls me lots of things. Um...

137
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
笑笑骨、小奶头...
Funny bones, nipple-head--

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,520
驯鹿宝贝?
Baby reindeer?

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,560
她应该不是律师吧
I'm assuming she's not a lawyer.

141
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,720
对 根本不可能 她成天在心跳里干坐着
No, she can't be. Spends all day sitting in the Heart.

142
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,080
心跳? 卡姆登区的那家酒吧?
The Heart? The pub in Camden?

144
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,880
- 我刚才说什么了? - 心跳
- Uh, what did I say? - The Heart.

145
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,000
你是在那遇见她的?
Is that where you met?

147
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,280
对 其实我有点记不大清了
 yeah, I'm just trying to remember, actually.

148
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,560
卡姆登区就那一家心跳酒吧
Well, there's only one Heart in Camden.

149
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,880
我现在都不敢去了
I don't go there anymore.

150
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,680
你昨天才去过
According to these, you were there yesterday.

151
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,280
我没有 是她瞎编的
I wasn't. She's just lying.

152
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,040
警察怎么说?
What are the police saying to all this?

153
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,400
我觉得这事还不至于...
Oh, I... I don't think it merits...

154
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,400
没那么严重吧
I mean, it's not that bad.

155
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,080
但已经严重到我们需要暂时低调了
But bad enough that we need to lay low for a while.

156
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,120
你为什么不报警?
Why haven't you reported this?

157
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,200
不知道 她只是有点疯疯癫癫的
I don't know. She's just batty.

158
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,760
除了会发些奇怪的邮件 其实并没有对我造成多大困扰
I mean, apart from a few random emails, it really isn't all that much.

159
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
我只是不想把你也卷进来
I just didn't wanna drag you into it.

160
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,960
"没多大困扰"?
Not that much?

161
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,800
她有妄想症 给自己幻想出了一个全新的身份
She's a fantasist who's fabricated an entire identity for herself.

162
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,880
这危险信号还不够强烈吗 托尼?
Does that not scream alarm bells, Tony?

163
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,600
不一定吧 人都会出于各种原因说谎
I don't know about that. People lie for all sorts of reasons.

164
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,120
不会说这样的谎
Not like this they don't.

165
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,440
答应我 你会解决这件事
Promise me you'll shut this down.

166
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,720
因为我不会逃避任何人
Because I'm not hiding from anyone.

167
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,360
如果你解决不了 也许我只好到卡姆登区
If you don't, I might have to come to Camden

168
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,920
去找她当面说了
and pay her a visit myself.

169
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,120
整件事宛如一场噩梦 每一个谎言和错误的决定
It was like some crazy nightmare, where each lie and wrong decision

170
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,880
都莫名地拉近着玛莎和泰瑞的距离
somehow bound Martha and Teri closer together.

171
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,640
仿佛在冥冥之中
Like the universe was punishing me

172
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,720
每当我想要全身而退时 都会遭到上天的惩罚
every single time I tried to cower my way out of the situation.

173
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,960
天哪 小奶头
Jeezo, nipple!

174
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,720
我在这里为你担心15分钟了
Fifteen minutes I've been here worrying my head off about you.

175
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
说真的 你要迟到的话 得先跟我打个招呼呀
Honestly! You need to tell me when you're running late.

176
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,360
至少把你的电话号码给我吧 我就不用干着急了
At least give me your goddamn phone number so I won't have to worry so much.

177
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,200
来吧 你知道该怎么做 小奶头
Come on, you know the drill, nipple.

178
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,000
快给我来杯健怡可乐喝喝 然后我就得走了
Quick Diet Coke to wet the whistle, and I'll be offski.

179
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,800
两块五英镑 谢谢
£2.50, please.

180
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,040
- 你从来不收我钱的 - 我必须收
- You never charge me. - I have to.

182
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
- 我买不起 - 你不是律师吗?
- I can't afford it. - Thought you were a lawyer, no?

183
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,920
你今天怎么这么奇怪?
What you being weird for?

184
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,640
我没有 只是我觉得 咱俩是时候划清界限了
I'm not. I just think it's time we drew a few boundaries.

185
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,600
你说过会满足我的需求
You said about the curtains.

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,120
我知道 那是在开玩笑 我是个喜剧人 就爱开玩笑
I know. That was a joke. I'm a comedian. I make jokes.

187
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,520
什么? 所以...
What? So...

188
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,720
你和我之间的一切...都只是个玩笑?
this has all been... one big wind-up, has it?

189
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,000
疯女人玛莎 自作聪明 结果小丑竟是我?
Crazy Martha... with her big brain. Joke's on her?

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,760
不 不是那样的
No, no, it's... it's not like that.

191
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,640
你说过好多撩我的话 小驯鹿
You've said a lot of shit to me, reindeer.

193
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,040
不 玛莎 请你别哭
Yeah. No, Martha, uh, please don't cry.

195
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,360
什么?
What?

196
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,920
你是说对我从来就没感觉吗?
Are you saying you've never had feelings for me?

197
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,000
不 很显然 我没那么说
No. No, I'm not saying that, obviously.

198
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,400
我觉得你很好 只是...
I think you're... great. It's just...

199
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,320
只是什么?
What is it?

200
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,160
- 是什么? - 年龄差距
- Well, what is it? - The age gap.

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
但我们的年龄差距不算太大呀
But there's not that much of an age gap.

202
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,840
对 但等我想要孩子
Yeah, but by the time I want kids,

203
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,800
想要一个大家庭时 问题就大了
you know, like a big family, it's... it's... it's gonna matter.

204
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,400
确实会有点麻烦
Oh, that'd be tricky.

205
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,320
是啊
Yeah.

206
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,720
这个该死的世界
This fucking world.

207
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,640
就只会肆无忌惮地索取
All it does is take from you.

208
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,040
{\an8}经血从我的阴道凶涌而出 一大堆黏乎乎的东西

209
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,600
{\an8}医生说我的卵子 好象20岁女生的一样哦

210
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,400
{\an8}你响什么时候来播种呀?

211
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,160
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

212
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,360
那一晚 玛莎的邮件疯狂涌入 一封接一封地
That night, Martha flooded my account with email after email

213
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,640
细数着她的月经 卫生棉条 血块
detailing periods, tampons, blood clots,

214
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,320
强调她旺盛的生育能力
reinforcing this image of her fertility.

215
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,360
在她眼里 我已没有任何理由推开她了
There was no excuse now, in her eyes.

216
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,840
我们俨然就要确定关系
We were becoming a thing.

218
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,960
快点 小驯鹿
Quick! Reindeer!

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,920
快呀 开门
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Open!

220
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,880
现在每天早上 玛莎都会在
Every morning now, Martha would arrive

221
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,880
开店前两小时赶到
exactly two hours before the pub opened.

222
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,000
然后在酒吧待一整天 跟在我屁股后头
Then all day she would trail me around the bar,

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
无休止地畅谈着我们的未来
talking endlessly about our future together.

224
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,280
我仔细考虑过了 我愿意
I've thought hard about it, and my answer's yes.

225
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,560
- 愿意什么? - 跟你结婚生子 生一大堆
- Yes to what? - Kids, marriage, the full nine yards.

226
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,640
我从来没说过要跟你结婚
I never said anything about marriage.

227
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,920
无论我去哪里 她都会出现
Everywhere I turned, she just seemed to be there,

228
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,200
在最不合时宜的时刻蹦出来 谈论我们的未来
popping up at the most inopportune moments to talk about our future together.

229
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,680
我们的婚礼 要给孩子取什么名字...
Our wedding day, what we were gonna call our kids...

230
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,680
只要抓紧时间 我应该能生三个
I think I can do three if we move quickly.

231
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,600
我连孩子的名字都想好了 你看
I've even been thinking of what to call them too. Here.

232
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,000
...那个画面让我不寒而栗 几乎跟她选的名字一样可怕
...the image of which horrified me almost as much as the names she'd chosen.

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,920
{\an8}爱格伯特-基斯-尼奥

234
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,280
我试着疏远她
I tried to distance myself,

235
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,800
但她依旧执迷不悟 一门心思缠着我
but she still persevered with the same dead-eyed commitment.

236
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,240
- 需要帮忙吗 弗兰基宝贝? - 不用
- Need a hand, Frankie baby? - What? No, I'm fine.

237
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,640
喜欢我叫你"弗兰基宝贝"吗?
Do you like that? "Frankie baby"?

238
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,880
取自双人组合成员弗兰基·辛纳特拉 他也有迷人的翘臀
From the duet. Frankie Sinatra. He had a gorgeous tush too.

240
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,360
我手里拿着热腾腾的餐食呢
I've got hot fucking plates in my hand.

241
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,840
- 你能别围着我转了吗? - 我买好半决赛的门票了
- Will you stop fussing around me? - I've got tickets to the semifinal.

242
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,920
什么?
What?

243
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,800
你比赛的门票 我会去为你助阵的
Tickets. For your competition. Gonna come down and empty my lungs.

244
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,680
我最近在学一首对唱曲目 这次我想唱凯莉和杰森的歌
Been learning a new duet too. I'm thinking Kylie and Jason this time.

245
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,400
- 你要来看比赛? - 当然
- You're coming to the competition? - Absolutely.

246
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,720
我还想着等半决赛结束了 跟你来场全垒打呢
And I thought, after your semi, I could give you a full erection.

247
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,000
我们得禁止玛莎入店
We need to bar Martha.

248
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,720
什么? 不可能
What? No chance.

249
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,960
那我们这一整年的笑料都没了
That'd be like barring a year's worth of banter.

250
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,800
说实在的 唐尼 没了她 你简直无聊透顶
Let's be honest, Donny. You're nothing without her.

251
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,560
听我说 好吗? 吉诺 请你出去一下
Just hear me out. Gino, can you leave?

252
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,560
不 你想跟我说什么 都可以当着我老婆的面说
No. What you can say in front of me, you can say in front of the missus.

253
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,160
听着 我有种不好的预感
Look, I'm just getting a bad feeling.

254
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,040
瞧瞧她发给我的这堆邮件 你看
I mean, look at all these emails she's been sending me. Here.

255
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,000
天哪 见鬼 这也太离谱了吧
Oh man. Oh, shit, man. That's... That is proper nuts.

256
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,640
- 现在明白了吧? - 我也拿不准
- Get my point? - I don't know.

257
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,880
这年头要禁止某人进店是很复杂的
Barring is complicated these days.

258
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,240
若没有实证 我们很可能引火烧身
Unless you've got evidence, it can come back on us.

259
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,560
- 她怎么会知道你的邮箱? - 这不重要
- How'd she get your email? - It doesn't matter.

260
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
重点是她知道了我的邮箱
All that matters is she did get it,

261
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,400
现在我们有充分的证据 禁止她进店 不是吗?
and now we have all the evidence we need to bar her, right?

262
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,920
证据确实不少 这条你看过了吗?
There's plenty of evidence here. You read this one?

263
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,840
不是吧 那也太野蛮了
Oh no. No, that... that is brutal.

264
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,920
- 哪一条? - 你求她跟你肛交那条
- Which one is that? - The one where you beg her for anal sex.

265
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,560
- 你胡说什么呢? - 你看
- What are you talking about? - Here.

266
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,080
在我看来 你似乎一直在求她跟你肛交啊
Looks to me like you've been begging her for anal sex, mate.

267
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,840
你回信了 你他妈在逗我吗?
You wrote back. Are you fucking kidding me?

268
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
{\an8}跟我肛交吧 

269
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,040
可恶 你居然发过去了
Shit, you actually sent it.

270
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,880
你傻吗? 你他妈是白痴吗?
Are you stupid? Are you a fucking moron?

271
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,800
冷静点 她只会把这当笑话看
Oh, chill. She'll see it as a joke.

272
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,040
{\an8}什么时候?

273
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
{\an8}在哪里?

274
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,160
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

275
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,960
简直难以置信
It was incredible, really, 

276
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,600
一切正以惊人的速度滑向崩溃的边缘
just how quickly things seemed to be falling apart.

279
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,840
你好 请问是杰森吗?
Hi, is that Jason?

280
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,760
你好 是的 我是唐尼 
Hi, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Donny. I'm just, um...

281
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,240
很抱歉这么晚打电话过来
I... I'm sorry to call so late.

282
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
请问能不能 把我半决赛的日期改到另一天?
I'm just wondering if I can move my semifinal to the other date?

283
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,680
对 我得处理一些家事 目前的日期我恐怕来不了
Yeah, I have to tend to some family shit, which means I can't do the current one.

284
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,040
天啊 你真是我的英雄
Oh man, you're a hero!

285
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,840
非常感谢 杰哥 我能叫你杰哥吗?
Thanks, Jase. Can I call you Jase?

286
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,640
好的 谢谢你 杰森 再见 伙计 再见
All right. Thanks, Jason. Bye, mate. Bye.

294
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,520
哇 你做到了
wow! You made it.

295
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,440
我特意选了一个同性恋酒吧 想看你会不会受不了
I picked the gayest bar intentionally just to see if you'd crack.

296
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,160
我知道 那我该怎么办? 要避免吸入空气中的微粒吗?
I know you did. So what do I do? Do I avoid breathing in the air particles?

297
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,080
别闹了
Oh, shut up!

298
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,360
你总能领会这种讽刺性的幽默 真好 否则你还挺让人受不了的
You'd be pretty damn intolerable if you didn't get irony.

299
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,400
- 我就当你是在夸我了 - 就是在夸你
- I'll take that as a compliment. - Mmm, you should.

300
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,960
我有同意你搂我的腰吗?
Did I give you consent to put your arms around my waist?

301
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,200
你有 你穿着这条 性感小裙子来赴约 就等于默许了
You did, actually, when you turned up in that skimpy little dress.

302
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,400
你还没喝就醉了吗?
Are you drunk already?

303
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,200
爱让我迷醉
Ah, just on love.

304
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,440
少来
Oh, go away.

305
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,040
真的 改天让你见见我的女神
I'm serious. You should meet her someday.

306
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,000
天啊 我超爱这首歌 来 我们去跳舞吧
Oh my God, I fucking love this song. Come on, let's dance. Let's dance.

307
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,080
- 我没想到你还会跳舞 - 我不会啊 但我要把你拖下水
- I didn't have you down as a dancer. - I'm not but I'll drag you down with me.

309
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,720
说真的 你怎么像变了个人似的 托尼去哪儿了?
Honestly, what have you done with him? Where's Tony?

310
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,800
我是他的双胞胎弟弟 他让我来替他把你拿下
I'm his twin. He sends me to seal the deal for him.

311
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,640
好吧 告诉他这是违法的
Well, tell him that's illegal.

312
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,920
什么违法?
What is?

313
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,600
用假身份跟人上床
Sleeping with someone under a false identity.

314
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,200
是吗?
Is it?

315
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,440
当然
Yeah, of course.

316
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,920
那你叫什么名字 双胞胎弟弟?
What's your name, then, twinny?

318
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,600
唐尼
Donny.

320
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,920
奇怪 玛莎就是这么叫你的
Weird. That's what Martha calls you.

321
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,600
是啊...
Yeah, um...

323
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,120
你还好吧?
Are you okay?

324
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,680
嗯 那个 我需要...
Yeah. Yeah. Um, tell you what, let me just, um...

325
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,680
失陪一下 好吗?
One second, yeah?

327
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,720
真他妈见鬼
Fuck's sake!

328
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,640
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

329
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,360
没事 我们去喝一杯吧?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Um, shall we get a drink?

330
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,360
你要不还是先缓缓吧
I think you should maybe slow down a bit.

331
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,520
- 好 - 过来 坐下
- Okay. - Here. Sit.

332
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,320
喝点水
Have some water.

333
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,360
可恶
Oh, fuck.

334
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,240
今天是不是出了什么事? 你似乎很困扰
Did something happen to you today? You seem troubled.

335
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,600
不 我没事
No, I'm fine.

336
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,560
不会是玛莎吧?
Martha, by any chance?

337
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,800
直觉告诉我 这事一定很有意思
Something tells me I'm gonna enjoy this.

338
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,760
不 我只是...我想婉转地拒绝她
No, I just, um... I thought I'd let her down gently

339
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,680
所以编了个借口说我想要孩子
by making out that I wanted kids and stuff.

340
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,920
真是越来越有趣了
Oh, this gets better and better.

341
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,720
- 想知道我的想法吗? - 我想不想你都会照说不误吧
- Do you wanna know what I think? - I think you're gonna tell me anyway.

342
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,960
我觉得你乐在其中
I think you're enjoying this.

343
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,240
你只不过读了几封邮件而已 别一副洞察一切的样子
You've read a few emails. Stop acting like you know the situation.

344
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,480
我用谷歌搜索过她
You know, I googled her.

346
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,240
你为什么没告诉我她以前坐过牢?
Why didn't you tell me that she'd been to jail before?

347
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
我感觉那无关紧要
Didn't seem relevant.

348
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,640
明白我的意思了吧?
See what I mean?

349
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,240
任何一个理智清醒的人 被有暴力倾向的前科犯盯上
Any sane person who was getting stalked by a violent ex-convict

350
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,160
都会毫不犹豫地报警
wouldn't hesitate to go to the police.

351
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,200
但你没有
But not you.

352
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,440
在你看来 她人畜无害
To you, she's harmless.

353
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,320
在你看来 她值得同情
To you, she's sympathetic.

354
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,160
在你看来 她坐过牢无关紧要?
To you, it's not relevant?

355
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,640
我只是想说 你之所以让她 一直缠着你不放 是有原因的
I'm just saying, there's a reason you're keeping her around,

356
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,840
也许重点不在于她是谁
and maybe it's not so much who she is, .

357
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,240
而在于她能给予你什么
but..what she gives you.

359
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,360
因为 敞开了说吧
Because let's be honest,

360
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,400
被人一厢情愿单恋的感觉 实在太舒适了
love is most comforting, isn't it, when it's felt one way.

361
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,120
不然你以为我为什么会在这里?
Why else do you think I'm here?

362
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,040
你就是个大骗子
You're a tremendous liar.

363
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,560
今晚跟我回家吧
Come back with me tonight.

364
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,520
只是别告诉托尼
Just don't tell Tony.

365
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,440
好
Okay.

366
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,520
{\an8}小驯鹿 你在哪? 你不能撩完人家就玩失宗

367
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,840
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

368
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
有时候当你编织出一张谎言的巨网
Sometimes you create such a web of lies that you almost forget

370
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,000
会几乎忘了 自己一开始想要逃离的是什么
what you started running from in the first place.

371
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,760
但此刻我站在这里 眼前是我的梦中情人
But here I was, the woman of my dreams before me,

372
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,440
建筑师托尼 还差四站就要踏上性犯罪的不归路
Tony the builder, four stops away from a sex crime.

373
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,480
天啊
Oh my God.

374
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,600
没想到我喝得这么醉
I'm way drunker than I thought I was.

375
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,560
可气的是 偏偏我现在恢复清醒了
Annoyingly, just as my sobriety returns.

376
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,240
天啊 真抱歉
Oh my God, I'm so sorry!

377
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,720
站着别乱晃 好吗?
Just keep still, will you?

378
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,080
我好像踩到了一个老太太
I think I just stepped on an old lady.

379
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,840
小声点 好吗?
Just... just keep it down a bit, yeah?

380
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,600
你顾虑太多了
You care too much.

381
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,160
我不鼓励嗑药 但我觉得那或许对你有好处
I don't encourage drug addiction, but I think it might be good for you.

382
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,200
来 把手给我
Here, give me your hands.

383
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,640
你造房子时会换一双手吗?
When you do your building work, do you put a new set of hands on?

384
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,400
什么意思?
What do you mean?

385
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,480
它们不像建筑工人那种布满老茧的手
It's just they're not very calloused for a builder.

386
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,480
这双是我的自慰专用手 我每天都把它们和工作手换着用
Oh, these are my wanking hands. I swap them round every day.

387
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,720
你试过用长满老茧的手自慰吗?
You ever tried wanking with calloused hands?

388
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,720
我还挺期待的
I was rather looking forward to it.

389
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,280
你要怎样才肯好好吻我一下?
What's it gonna take for you to finally give me a proper kiss?

390
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,120
抱歉 你说什么?
Sorry, what was that?

391
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,560
吻我
Kiss me.

392
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,760
本以为我是个积极主动的人 却发现我骨子里是个懦夫
It is so devastating to think of yourself as a progressive person,

393
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,400
{\an8}泰瑞来电

394
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,520
那打击简直令人崩溃
only to realize you're a coward underneath it all.

395
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,680
但当你花费漫长的时间 消化内心的羞耻
But when you spend so long swallowing your shame,

396
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,400
它会不可避免地转化为你的一部分
it is so hard to stop it becoming part of you.

397
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,080
你这小色鬼
You filthy fucker.

398
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,000
我从来没跟人肛交过 但为了你 我愿意妥协
I've never taken it up the chufter, but I might make concessions for you.

399
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,880
求你了 玛莎 我只想回家
Please, Martha. I just need to go home.

400
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,280
你得二选一哦 小帅哥
You got a choice, boy.

401
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,040
是想要孩子还是欢乐肛交
Kids or bum fun.

402
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,680
我不知道法夫的综合学校 是怎么教的生理课
'Cause I don't know what they taught you in those Fife comprehensives,

403
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,160
但靠肛交是没法生小孩的
but if you stick it in the two, then you don't get the 2.4.

405
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,880
- 懂我的意思吗? - 玛莎 拜托你回家吧
- Do you know what I mean? - Martha, just go back home.

406
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,160
我真的很烦你这套 犹豫不决 忽冷忽热的把戏
You're really getting on my nerves with this dilly-dally, hot-and-cold shit!

407
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,160
- 让开 玛莎 - 不让
- Get out of my way, Martha. No!

408
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,240
我已经把心给了你
I've already given parts of myself away to you.

409
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,680
你要想推开我 至少该给我一个解释
So the least you can do is piece me back together

410
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,760
让我对你死心吧?
with some bloody justification.

411
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,200
我告诉你 你最好考虑清楚
Because let me tell you this for size.

412
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,480
看不上我的男人
Men who don't fancy me

413
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,240
不是眼瞎就是同性恋
are either blind or gay.

414
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,800
我可没见你爬楼梯时去摸索扶手
I don't see you reaching for the banister when you climb the stairs.

415
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,240
我他妈的才不是同性恋 玛莎 天哪
No, I'm not fucking gay, Martha. Jesus.

416
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,080
那就别再推开我了
Then stop pushing me away.

417
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,480
我可以帮你的 知道吗?
I can help you, you know?

418
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,800
帮我什么?
Help with what?

419
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
那个人
The person.

420
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,920
- 伤害了你的人 - 我不知道你在说什么
- The one that hurt you. - I don't know what you're talking about.

421
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,480
那是个男人 对吧?
It was a man, wasn't it?

422
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,360
他对你做了什么?
What did he do to you?

423
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,000
好了 我要走了 好吧?
Okay, I'm just gonna leave, yeah?

424
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,840
我现在转身走开 你不要跟上来
I'm just gonna turn and walk away, and you're not to follow.

425
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,000
听明白了吗?
Do you understand?

426
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,080
很好
