1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,640
袭击泰瑞之后没多久 玛莎就被酒吧禁止进入了
Martha was barred for an incident shortly after the attack on Teri.

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,920
找到你了 
There you are!

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,440
脚踏两条船的懦夫 渣男
You cowardly, two-timing fuck.

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,640
你那晚很有种啊 竟敢堂而皇之地把那贱人带到我面前
The nerve you showed me the other night, rubbing that skank in my face.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,240
好了 够了 玛莎
All right, that's enough, Martha.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,200
你现在是我的敌人了 驯鹿宝贝
You've made an enemy of me, reindeer.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,840
- 别以为我会放过你 - 玛莎
- Make no mistake about it. Martha!

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,440
- 希望你清楚自己干的好事... - 够了
- I hope you know what you've done... Enough!

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,160
- ...居然这样伤害我 - 玛莎
- ...in wounding me like this. Martha!

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,320
你那张轻浮的嘴 迟早会给你惹麻烦 小子
Your mouth's gonna get you in trouble, boy.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,960
有那么一瞬间 我以为整件事会到此结束
For a moment, I thought that might be the end of it,

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,880
但她却开始 在我生活中的所有其他场合出没
but she just multiplied across all other areas of my life.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,880
嘿 你们真该瞧瞧他女朋友长什么样 十足的丑八怪
Hey, you should see the woman he's dating. Pig ugly.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,560
他自轻自贱 在臭水沟里找女人
If he stooped any lower, he'd be a hunchback.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,400
好的 女士们先生们 你们好...
Yes! Uh, hello, ladies and gentlemen, s--

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,000
他是个驼背佬 卡西莫多
He's a hunchback! Quasimodo!

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,800
佝偻着背在臭水沟里找女人
Head in a gutter of skanks!

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,120
好啊 他来了 脚踏两条船的放浪先生
Yeah, there he is, Mr. Two-timing Slut.

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,480
千万别相信他
Don't trust him, guys.

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,920
他会许诺跟你上床 然后溜之大吉
He'll promise you sex, then sprint the other way.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,160
这一切的一切 都让我不堪其扰
It was killing me, all of it.

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,840
不过 由于演出被玛莎破坏 我得以自动晋级决赛
A free pass to the comedy final on account of Martha ruining the gig

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,120
也算在一团乱麻的当下 给了我一丝慰藉
offered little comfort in the face of everything.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,480
我考虑过辞掉酒吧的工作 搬家
I thought about quitting the bar or moving house

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,320
或者暂停发展喜剧事业
or pausing the comedy for a while,

26
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,120
但我不想再让她得逞 
but I didn't wanna give her the satisfaction

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,760
让她对我予取予求了
of taking any more than she had.

28
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,280
所以我只好静观其变
So all that was left to do was lie and wait,

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,600
揣测她还有可能做出什么事来
questioning what else she might be capable of.

30
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,400
{\an8}别以为我会善霸甘休 驯鹿宝贝 从我iPhone发送

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,840
{\an8}《驯鹿宝贝》

32
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,080
妈妈 刚才有人朝我脸上泼东西
Mum! Someone just threw something in my face.

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,440
- 没事的 冲干净就好 - 天哪
You'll be all right. Just wash it out.

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,920
怎么了?
What's going on?

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,320
- 刚才有人攻击我 - 什么?
- Someone just attacked me! - What?

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,960
我还以为是强酸 还以为我要瞎了呢
I thought it was acid. I thought I was gonna go blind.

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,400
天哪 结果是什么?
Jesus. I mean, what was it?

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,680
我不知道 感觉是汽水 好像是可乐
I don't know. It was, like, a fizzy drink. It was Coke, I think.

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,800
可乐? 会不会是
Coke? As in, like... As in, like... like

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,360
健怡可乐?
Diet Coke?

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,760
我没工夫关注它的含糖量 唐尼
I wasn't paying attention to the sugar content, Donny.

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,280
- 天哪  - 是啊 不 当然
- Jesus Christ! - Yeah, no, of course.

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,280
是来过我们烹饪小组的那女人
It was that woman from the cooking group.

45
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,920
我走到窗边时 看见她沿着街道跑远了
I saw her running down the street when I came to the window.

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,480
是嘛 不 我好像对她有印象 对
Oh yeah. No, I... I... I think I remember her. Yeah.

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,520
她在泼我的脸之前说了 "去死吧 唐尼"
She said, "That's for fucking Donny," before she threw it in my face.

48
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,400
这究竟是怎么一回事?
What is going on here?

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,640
那个女人
She's this woman.

51
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,560
她这段时间
She's been

52
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
一直在跟踪我
stalking me.

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,920
她一直在跟踪你?
She's been stalking you?

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,160
慢着 她就是在脸书上骚扰我的 那个玛莎吗?
Wait, is this that Martha woman who's been harassing me on Facebook?

55
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,040
天啊
Oh my God.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,240
她来过我家
She's been in my home.

57
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,680
你他妈的真是个白痴 知道吗?
You are a fucking idiot. You know that?

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,280
- 她跟踪你多久了? - 我不知道 六个月吧
- How long's this been going on for? - I don't know. Like, six months.

60
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,400
- 六个月? - 你报警了吗?
- Six months?! - Have you been to the police?

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,560
报过了 但警察没当回事
Yeah, I have, but they, you know, wouldn't take it seriously.

62
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,920
加上刚才发生的事 他们也许就会当回事了
They might if you tell them what just happened to me.

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
什么事? 有人朝你脸上泼可乐?
What, that someone threw a Coke in your face?

65
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,120
真不敢相信你会说出这种话
You know what? I can't believe you.

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,320
不 我不是那个意思 我的意思是...
No, that wasn't what I meant. I just meant...

67
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
天啊 我只是想说
Oh my God, I'm just saying, like,

68
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,080
这女人一天给我发好几百封邮件 他们都没当回事
if they don't take this woman sending me hundreds of emails a day seriously,

69
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,080
泼汽水这种事就更不会了
they're not gonna give much of a shit about a soft drink, are they?

70
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,920
那样的话...
Well, in that case...

71
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,200
虽然很过意不去 但是唐尼
I really hate to do this to you, Donny.

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
我觉得你最好还是搬出去吧
I think you'd better move out.

73
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,160
我搬到了基尔伯恩 跟在表演学院认识的两个人同住
I moved to Kilburn with two guys from my drama-school days.

74
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,560
房东是他们其中一个的父亲 所以我能勉强承担租金
One of their dads owned the flat, so it was just about affordable for me.

75
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,120
原以为住宿条件会很糟糕
I expected the absolute worst,

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,080
但当门打开 看见新住处的那一刻
but as the door opened onto my new place,

77
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,800
我对眼下处境的忧虑和沮丧 便统统烟消云散了
all my dread and frustration at the whole situation just vanished.

78
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,440
这里堪称完美 是一个全新的开端
It was perfect. A fresh start.

79
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,120
我又能把自己隐藏起来了
Anonymity again.

80
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,360
天哪 这地方太棒了
Holy shit, this place is nuts.

81
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,400
是啊 是难得一遇的好房
Yeah, it's such a find, honestly.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,760
天啊 瞧那阳台
Jesus Christ. The balcony!

83
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
是啊 俯视为生活奔波的芸芸众生 总是感觉特别好
Yeah. Always nice to look down on people as they go about their lives.

84
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,760
我以为你在私立学校已经看得够多了
Thought you'd have done enough of that at private school.

86
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,540
两年没见 你都开始拿社会阶层开涮了
Haven't seen you for two years, already with the class digs. Good.

87
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,120
喜剧事业进展如何了?
How's the comedy going?

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,480
还不错 最近晋级了一个 喜剧新人比赛的决赛
Yeah, not bad. Got to the final of a new-act competition recently.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,880
新人?
New act?

90
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,840
你混那行都五年了吧
You've been doing this for five years now.

91
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,600
照这个速度下去 估计到领养老金时都还没混出头呢
At this rate, I'll still be doing them when I'm picking up my pension.

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600
你呢? 最近在忙什么?
How about you? What are you up to?

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,120
- 我正休学一年 - 在伦敦?
- I'm taking a gap year. In London?

94
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
是在工作吗? 想存点钱?
Are you working? Saving up or something?

95
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,400
没有 我目前靠存款过日子
Nah, I'm, uh, living off my savings.

96
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,440
还在寻找方向 享受自由
Finding my way. Enjoying my freedom.

97
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,760
我们的无线网是蹭楼下咖啡馆的网速超快 还能省网费
We steal Wi-Fi from the café downstairs. It's fast as fuck, so we save there too.

99
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,200
天哪 这地方也好得太不真实了吧
Fucking hell, this is insane.

100
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,240
背后有什么猫腻吗?
What's the catch?

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,440
{\an8}好久没在你住的街区看见你 胆小鬼 朵起来了?

102
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,120
{\an8}没种象个男人一样 跟我把话说清楚吗?

103
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,840
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

104
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,920
烦人的是 如我所料 弗兰西斯果然有所隐瞒
I found it tediously predictable that Francis had failed to mention

105
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,280
他和毕玖休学是为了实现他们...
that him and Bijou had taken time off to fulfil their...

106
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,960
探索文化和精神活性的使命
Cultural, psychoactive destiny, man.

107
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,360
就是嗑迷幻药 兄弟
Psychedelics, bro.

108
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,560
它会给你带来 前所未有的洞察力和清晰的思维
They give you an insight, a clarity, like nothing you've seen before.

109
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,720
我想也是
My thoughts exactly.

110
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,600
对于休学一年 大部分人会想到搭飞机旅行
A gap year, people think that means getting on planes and shit,

111
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,640
但其实在自家客厅 也能享受完整的往返旅程 兄弟
but you can do an entire round trip inside your living room these days, brother.

112
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,920
听起来真令人神往 
This all sounds very riveting,

113
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,400
但不介意的话 我现在想拉屎
but if it's okay, I'd quite like to take a shit now.

114
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,720
这就是我现在的生活
So this was my life.

115
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,880
躲在卧室里 热气穿过地板蒸腾而上
Hiding away in my bedroom while the heat rose through the floor

116
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,360
墙壁被人类有史以来 最烂的音乐震得嗡嗡响
and the walls pounded with the shittest fucking music known to man,

117
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,160
而压垮我最后一丝神经的
feeling utterly overcome

118
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,280
是对玛莎那排山倒海般的恨意
with how much I hated Martha.

119
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,360
{\an8}你跑哪去了?

120
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,920
{\an8}iPhone发送

121
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,640
有人吗?
Hello?

122
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,280
我有个女儿 现在两个月大
I've got a daughter. Two month-old. Two-month-old, right?

123
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,400
我给她取名阿道夫 开玩笑的啦
So I called her Adolf. I'm joking! I'm joking!

124
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,520
你们在干什么?
What's going on?

125
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,440
她已经满三个月了
She's three months old.

126
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,720
真他妈见鬼
Oh, for fuck's sake.

127
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
快把那破玩意关掉
Look, just fucking get that off.

128
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,840
关了也没用 我们都看过好几遍了
No point. We've watched 'em all several times.

129
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,040
问这个或许有点失礼 但你的笑话为什么那么无趣?
This is gonna sound like a crass question, but why isn't it funny?

130
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,120
问诺里奇去 是诺里奇那地方的人无趣
Ask Norwich. It's Norwich that's not funny.

131
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,080
说真的 我们只笑了两秒钟 然后就一直坐在那儿为你感到郁闷
We laughed at it for two seconds, then sat around depressed as fuck for you.

132
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,400
就好比如果有人死了 谁都知道不能拿那种事开玩笑
It's like when someone dies, and you know you can't joke about it.

133
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
我都不敢再嗑迷幻药了
It makes me not wanna do acid again

134
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,800
生怕醒来发现自己 成了你笑话里的一个段子
in case I wake up inside your comedy routine.

135
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,120
抱歉 这是谁?
Sorry, who's this?

136
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,440
- 他是狄格西 新来的 - 你还挺自来熟的 是吧?
- That's Digsy. He's new. - Make yourself at home, why don't you?

137
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,960
别拿狄格西撒气 视频的事是玛莎告诉我们的
Whoa, don't take it out on Digsy. It was Martha that told us.

138
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,920
我差点立马解除了对她的禁制
I almost unbarred her there and then.

139
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,200
你没那个权力 肥仔
You don't have the authority to do that, you fat prick.

140
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,280
说句公道话 观众的反应过于冷淡了 其实有些地方还挺好笑的
To be fair, it's a lot funnier than the audience are giving you credit for.

141
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,320
- 确实 - 对 非常有趣
- That's true. - Yeah, marginally so.

142
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,200
不用可怜我 那是我第一次演出 我现在进步多了
Don't pity me. That was my first gig. I'm a lot better now.

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,240
我们拭目以待呢
Well, we look forward to seeing it.

144
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,560
是啊 在那之前 我想把那视频投影到墙上
Yeah, and until then, I'm thinking let's project that on the wall.

145
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,920
- 让整个酒吧的人都乐一乐 - 对
- Beam this cunt round the entire pub. - Right.

146
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,880
好吧?
Yeah?

149
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,280
我开始越来越长时间地在泰瑞家停留
I started spending more and more time around Teri's place.

150
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,600
本以为玛莎的那次袭击 会让她对我避而远之
I thought the incident with Martha would be the end of us,

151
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,240
但没想到 我们反而比以前更亲近了
but instead it bound us tighter than ever before,

152
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,480
泰瑞的经历使得她能更好地理解我
Teri's experience allowing her to better understand mine.

154
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,640
天哪 那群人真是混蛋
Jesus, those guys are such assholes.

155
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,720
你有告诉他们 你进入了一个喜剧比赛的决赛吗?
Did you tell them you have a big, fancy comedy final coming up?

156
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,840
没有 哪怕我真当上了 笑鸭年度最佳新人
No, I don't think the prospect of becoming the Laughing Duck New Act of the Year

157
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,000
他们也不会对我嘴软的
would have done me favors in a conversation like that.

159
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,560
等你把冠军奖杯抱回家的时候 
They'll be laughing on the other side of their face

160
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
他们就笑不出来了
when you take home the crown.

162
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,400
我喜欢这态度
I like that attitude.

163
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,640
- 对了 别太习惯现在这样的好日子 - 不会的
- Don't get used to this, by the way. I won't.

164
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,720
- 太辣了吗? - 太辣?
- Too much chili? Too much?

165
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,760
天哪 泰瑞 这简直是地狱级的辣椒酷刑
Christ, Teri, they're gonna feed me this in hell!

166
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,680
天啊
Oh my God!

167
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,640
给 喝你的奶吧 小弱鸡
Here, drink your milk, pussy!

168
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,960
我感觉仿佛能看见来世了
I feel like I can see into the next life.

169
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,160
在泰瑞舒适的公寓里
And within the comfort of Teri's flat,

170
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,120
她感觉够安心 我觉得够私密
with all the safety she needed and all the privacy I did,

171
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,960
我们很快发展成了甜蜜的小情侣 其实早该如此的
we flourished into the couple we should have always been.

172
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,320
在某种奇怪的意义上 虽然得到了想要的一切
And in a strange sense, I'd gotten everything I'd ever wanted,

173
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,960
一段隐秘的恋情
a closed-door relationship,

174
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,280
但我内心却难以抑制地 对玛莎抱有某种扭曲的感恩心理
as I tried very hard not to feel grateful towards Martha in some fucked-up way.

175
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,040
你是何时发现自己 愿意和跨性别女性约会的?
When did you first figure out you were open to dating trans women?

176
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,200
大概是我问上帝 能否让我的生活更复杂一点的那天吧
I think I asked God one day if he could make my life more complicated.

177
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,960
你的性取向是什么? 如果被人拿枪指着头问的话
How do you identify sexually? If there was a gun to your head.

178
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
拜托 快扣扳机吧
Oh, please, pull the trigger.

179
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,000
闭嘴 混蛋
Shut up, asshole.

180
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,280
我可不会喜欢你的葬礼 还有那些悼词
I don't fancy that funeral. All the speeches.

181
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,760
"唐尼是个特别搞笑的好小伙儿"
"Donny was a top lad with great banter."

182
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
是只会有我奶奶去致悼词吗?
Will my gran be the only one that's speaking?

183
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,680
回答我 笨蛋
Answer, idiot!

185
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,920
我不知道 也许是双性恋吧
I don't know. Like, bi, maybe.

186
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,920
为什么会是双性恋?
And what makes you bi?

187
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,000
因为无论跟谁上床 我都感觉自己是个骗子
Because I feel like a fraud no matter who I sleep with.

188
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,000
那要怎样才能给你信心?
What's it gonna take to give you some confidence, huh?

189
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,400
说真的 认真想想
Seriously, think about it.

190
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,840
不知道你想过这个问题没有
I'm not sure you ever have.

191
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,760
我也不知道 那句话是怎么说的来着?
I don't know. What's that phrase?

192
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,760
就是关于...跳舞和自信的那句
You know, the one about... dancing and watching.

193
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,960
自信就是旁若无人地起舞?
Confidence is dancing like no one's watching you?

194
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,480
对
Yeah.

195
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
我不知道
I don't know.

196
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,000
就感觉说得挺好的
Just seems quite nice.

197
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,240
那很简单啊
Well, that's easy.

198
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,160
看吧? 小菜一碟
See? Piece of cake.

199
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,720
是啊 而且看起来还很蠢呢
Yeah, and you look like a total knob too.

201
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,440
我可是学了十年芭蕾舞 和两年踢踏爵士舞呢
Ten years of ballet, two in tap and jazz.

202
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,960
我妈想要的绝对是个女孩
My mom definitely wanted a girl.

206
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,000
来吧 我教你
Come. I'll show you.

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,120
不要
No way.

208
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,360
- 别害羞呀 - 不行 绝对不要
- Don't be shy. - No, not a chance in hell.

209
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,680
- 试试看嘛 - 不要
- Just try. No, no.

210
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,080
- 我会像个木头一样 - 少无聊了
- I'll sandbag you. - Oh, don't be such a bore.

211
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,760
好吧 我变成木头了
Fine. I'm sandbagging.

212
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,320
不 我现在是木头 不要
No. I'm sandbagging. No.

213
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,880
你要真想这么扯皮 我可以跟你耗一整晚
I'll try all evening, if that's what it takes.

214
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,040
不 过来
No. No. Come here. Come here.

215
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,720
怎么样?
So?

216
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,400
跟我在一起时 会觉得自己是骗子吗?
Do you feel like a fraud with me?

217
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,440
不知道
I dunno.

218
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,640
我们还没试验过呢
We haven't put it to the test yet.

222
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,400
见鬼 我在发抖
Oh fuck, I'm shaking.

223
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,720
没关系 我可以接受 过来
That's okay. I can work with that. Come here.

227
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,120
怎么了?
What's going on?

228
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,560
不 没事 我只是发现很难...
No, no. I'm... I'm fine. I'm just finding it hard to...

229
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,480
摆脱内心的偏见?
Shake off your prejudice?

230
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,040
拜托 别在前戏时说教
Please. No lectures during foreplay.

231
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,600
少来 别跟我说你不会觉得 我讲课的样子很性感
Oh, come on. Don't act like you wouldn't find me hot as a lecturer.

232
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,080
穿着权力套装 戴着女秘书风格的黑框眼镜
- Mm. - Power suit. Secretary glasses.

233
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,080
握着用来鞭挞你的教鞭
One of those pointer things to hit you with.

234
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,960
抱歉 不 我还没准备好
Oh, I'm sorry. No. No. I'm... I'm not ready.

235
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,200
对不起 我的身体就是没反应
I'm sorry. My... my body, it's... it's just not letting me.

236
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,800
别担心 没关系
Hey, don't worry. It's fine.

237
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,080
这是常有的事
Happens all the time.

238
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,440
- 是吗? - 是啊
- Does it? - Yeah.

239
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,320
- 我早有耳闻了 - 闭嘴
- So I've heard. - Shut up!

241
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,480
- 你想喝杯茶吗? - 好啊 当然
- Would you like a tea or something? - Yeah, sure.

242
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,480
好的
Okay.

243
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,360
真是奇怪
It was strange.

244
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,880
我的身体经历了那么多可怕的事情
After all the awful things that had been done to my body,

245
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,760
面对真正亲密的人却无法再勃起
I just couldn't lose myself in intimacy anymore.

246
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,360
似乎牵扯到感情 一切都令我不堪重负
Now there were feelings involved, it all just felt too much.

247
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,400
那些抚摸 爱意 和一再的确认
The touch, the love, the confirmation.

248
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,000
{\an8}你元本是打算 同时睡我们两个吗?

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,280
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

250
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,840
抱歉 还是不行
Sorry, it's just not happening.

251
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,120
接下来的两周里 在多次尝试失败之后
Over the next fortnight, after repeated failed attempts,

252
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,160
我开始注意到泰瑞的一个变化
I started noticing a change in Teri.

253
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,760
几乎一整天都在床上度过
Days spent predominantly in bed,

254
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,680
穿着前一天的衣服 在家里神出鬼没地游荡
skulking around the house in yesterday's clothes,

255
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,000
模糊了白天和黑夜的界限 再没了往日的神采
blurring the line between night and day without her usual spark.

256
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,880
{\an8}上午11点52分

257
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,520
你还好吗?
Is everything okay?

258
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,400
嗯 还好
Yeah, I'm fine.

259
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,280
然后我在夜里醒来 发现她仿佛缩进了自己的壳里
Then I would wake in the night to find her shrinking inside of herself,

260
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,320
如同折翼的天使
her wings clipped.

261
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,120
你还好吗?
Is everything okay?

262
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,120
天哪 别再问了
My God, stop asking that.

263
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,880
你有什么心事可以跟我说 我也许能帮上忙
Well, maybe if you explain, I might be able to help.

264
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,120
看看我的头发 唐尼 瞧它现在成什么样儿了
Look at my hair, Donny. Look at the state of it.

265
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,200
- 又打结成一团一团的怪样子了 - 我觉得很好看呀
- It's growing back in weird clumps. - I think it looks great.

267
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,840
难看死了 你心里有数
It looks horrible, and you know it.

268
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,240
我看起来好像阴间大法师
I look like fucking Beetlejuice.

269
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,360
好极了 你还笑得挺开心
Great. Now you're laughing.

270
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,600
怎么了嘛? 真的很好笑
What? That was funny.

271
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,160
听着 泰瑞 如果你不开心 是因为我们做爱时的尴尬局面...
Look, Teri, if this is anything to do with all this awkward sex stuff...

272
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,480
不 是你在做爱时给我的感觉
No, it's the way you make me feel during the sex stuff.

273
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,200
好像你身体的反应在证实
Like your body's manifesting

274
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,360
她那晚对我说的所有过分的话
all the awful things she said to me that night.

275
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,000
不是的 泰瑞 这跟那个完全没关系
No, no, Teri, it's got nothing to do with that.

276
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,120
是玛莎的事影响了我 才害我表现失常的
It's just the whole Martha situation. That's what's getting to me here.

277
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,200
我只是压力太大了
I just feel so fucking stressed.

278
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,040
但你有在想办法 解决这个问题吗 唐尼?
But what are you even doing to fix the situation, Donny?

279
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,280
鬼知道我们已经在家里窝了多久
We've been stuck inside for God knows how long now,

280
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,160
等着你想通了
waiting for you to figure it out.

281
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,840
我试过去报警了 但他们帮不上忙
Well, I've been to the police, but they were useless.

282
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,080
你有提过我被袭击的事吗?
Did you mention what happened to me?

283
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,440
当然了
Of course I did.

284
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,520
那怎么警察没来找我问话?
Then why haven't they been round?

285
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,960
因为你根本就没提
It's because you didn't say shit!

286
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,040
不是的
That's not true.

287
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,200
她袭击我那晚你就不让我报警 
You stopped me calling them the night she attacked me.

288
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000
还阻止其他人报警
You stopped everyone calling.

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,200
你恨不得让我 立马从酒吧消失 越快越好
You couldn't have whisked me out of that pub any faster.

290
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,120
- 我是想把你带到安全的地方 - 是啊 当然是了
- I was trying to get you to safety. - Yeah. Sure you were.

291
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,560
你自以为是的安全
The safety inside your own fucking head.

292
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,560
她说我看起来像个男人 唐尼
She said I look like a man, Donny.

293
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,560
你知道我听了是什么感受吗?
Do you know what that's like for me?

294
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,080
我不知道
No, I don't.

295
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,760
但无论如何 你看起来一点也不像男人
But for what it's worth, you don't look like a man at all.

296
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,160
这话从一直把我当男人看待的人 嘴里说出来 可真有说服力
Pretty rich coming from someone who's always treated me like one.

297
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,560
我当时真该站起来就走
I should have gone then.

298
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,200
我真该握住泰瑞的手 
I should have grabbed Teri's hand

299
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,440
牵着她一起去警局
and brought her to the police station with me.

300
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,040
但最终还是羞耻感占了上风
But still my shame won out.

301
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,000
我不得不另寻他法
I just had to find a different way.

302
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,160
{\an8}我把话说青楚... 你永远别想得到我 一刻也别想

303
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,320
{\an8}我宁愿自尉十次 也不让你干我

304
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,280
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

305
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,680
我们不能指控某人自慰
We can't charge someone for masturbating.

306
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,000
不是自慰的问题 你看这邮件
It's not about the masturbating. Read the email.

307
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
发这种骚扰邮件应该是违法的吧
You shouldn't be allowed to send that.

308
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,640
就算有什么 她也在邮件里暗示不会靠近你了
If anything, her email implies that she's gonna stay away.

309
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,560
我觉得你没抓住重点
I think you're missing the point here.

310
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,080
我是在告诉你 对于你的指控 她会如何反驳
I'm giving you the arguments she'll come back with.

311
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
要以电子邮件为依据逮捕某人
To arrest someone on the basis of an email,

312
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,400
我们需要看到切实可信的威胁 或者具有攻击性的性骚扰
we need a credible threat or something sexually aggressive.

313
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,640
如果我是个年轻女人 而一个40岁的男人
If I was a young woman and a 40-year-old man

314
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,440
不停给我发邮件说手淫的事 这算切实可信的威胁吗?
kept emailing stuff about wanking, would that be a credible threat?

315
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,960
如果是女性被男性跟踪 我们会担心女方受到人身伤害
With male-to-female gender stalking, the threat of a man is physical.

316
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,160
男性通常更具有危险性
He carries more weight.

317
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,720
没有人比刀子更具有危险性了吧?
Nobody carries weight against a fucking knife, do they?

318
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,520
但凡我能看到任何证据 显示会发生暴力...
Again, if I could see any evidence that would suggest violence--

319
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,040
我的天哪 她正在毁掉我的生活
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, she's ruining my life here.

320
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,840
在系统里搜索她的名字 玛莎·史考特
Type her name into the system. Martha Scott.

321
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,240
会有发现的 我告诉你
There'll be something there. I'm telling you.

322
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,320
好吧
Right.

323
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,320
是的 我好像搜到她了
Yeah. I... I believe I've found her.

325
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,920
这样吧...
Just... Tell you what...

326
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,000
要不我把你的...
why... why don't... why don't I get you your, um...

327
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,400
要不这么着吧 你到里屋来好吗?
Actually, why don't you just come through to the back?

328
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,000
我觉得最好还是让我的上司来看一下
'Cause I'd better get my... my supervisor just to look through this.

329
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,920
- 不好意思 我们在等人吗? - 对
- Sorry, is there someone coming? Yeah. Uh...

330
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
她来了
Oh, just... just now, in fact.

331
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,400
谢谢
Thank you.

332
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,000
下午好 我是乔安·卡尔瓦警探
Good afternoon. I'm Detective Joanne Culver.

333
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,800
所以 玛莎·史考特
So, Martha Scott.

334
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,920
对
Yeah.

335
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,920
我不能说太多
I can't say too much here,

336
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,920
但你只需要知道 她是一个非常执着女人
but all you need to know is she is a very serious woman.

337
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,680
执着到甚至曾经跟踪过一名警察
So serious that she once stalked a policeman.

338
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,960
好吧
Right.

339
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,920
我的同事告诉我 她不知道你的电话号码 
My colleague tells me she's not in possession of your phone number.

340
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,880
对吗?
Is that correct?

341
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,640
是的 没错
Yeah, that's... that's correct.

342
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,400
很好 务必确保不要让她知道 好吗?
Good. Let's make sure we keep it that way, shall we?

343
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,440
好
Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,720
理想情况下 我们会希望你画出一个时间线
Now, ideally, you would draw up a timeline for us.

345
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,320
列出目前为止发生的一切 好让我们大致估计一下严重程度
Everything that's happened thus far, to give us a sense of the scale of it.

346
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,000
可以 那与此同时呢?
That's fine. And in the meantime?

347
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,560
我们会找她谈谈
We will talk to her,

348
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,760
警告她以后不要有过分举动
warn her regarding any future conduct.

349
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,680
太好了
Great.

350
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
然后呢?
Then what?

351
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,560
你会发现有了警方的介入 情况会大为改观的 邓恩先生
The presence of the police can change things, Mr. Dunn.

353
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,080
我明白 但你刚刚才说了
Mm, I get that, but you literally just said

354
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,880
她是一个很执着的女人 甚至跟踪过警察
she's a serious woman who even stalks policemen.

355
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,840
我们会尽力而为
We'll do what we can.

356
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,760
警察对玛莎登门拜访后 她忽然安静了下来
The police's presence at Martha's door brought with it a sudden silence.

357
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,680
诡异 可怕的寂静
Strange, eerie silence.

358
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,440
从我遇见她的那一刻起 她每天都会持续不断地联系我
Not a single day from the moment I met her did she not contact me.

359
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,080
如今却沉寂了下来
Now silence.

360
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,200
诡异 可怕的寂静
Strange, eerie silence.

361
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,360
几周过去了 我开始恐慌
Weeks went by, and I started to panic.

362
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,120
透过那些邮件 我能看到她所有不同的情绪
The emails allowed me to tune into every facet of her emotion.

363
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,640
知道她什么时候伤心了 什么时候想我了
I knew when she was sad, when she missed me,

364
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,520
什么时候生病 喝醉 或是生气了
when she was ill or drunk or angry.

365
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,880
现在只有一片空白
Now nothing.

366
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,680
我发现自己开始夜不成寐
I found myself awake at night,

367
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,760
事实上 我既担心又害怕
worried, terrified, in fact,

368
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,920
怕哪天一早起床 会发现她已经自寻短见
that I was gonna get up one morning to find she'd killed herself,

369
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,880
而我的收件箱里躺着一封邮件 说她是因我而死
an email in my inbox expressing that I was the reason why.

370
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,360
{\an8}事件时间表 8月21日-玛莎来到酒吧

371
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,760
我在想念她吗?
Did I miss her?

372
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,640
我在内心深处对她念念不舍吗?
Was there some part of me that missed her?

373
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
怀念她的胡闹和关注
Missed the drama, missed the attention,

374
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,920
以及她会让我暂时忘却那个男人 泰瑞 我自己 还有发生的一切
missed the distraction from him and Teri and myself and what happened.

375
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,960
我在想念她吗?
Did I miss her?

376
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
而整件事里最奇怪的就是
And the strangest part about all of this,

377
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,760
我开始对着玛莎的照片手淫了
I started to masturbate over Martha.

378
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
做出这种会让我濒临破碎的生活
There was something so awful yet thrilling

379
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,520
愈加万劫不复的事情 是如此糟糕 却又无比刺激
about doing something that would devastate my life even further.

380
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,880
每次我都能很快高潮 继而在事后留下相同的疑问
I would come quickly every time and be left with the same confusion

381
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,400
那简直成了我高潮后的标志性困惑
that had become my post-orgasm trademark.

382
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,320
"我在搞什么鬼? 事情怎么会变成这样?"
"What the fuck was that? Where did that come from?"

383
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,800
她对我毫无吸引力
I wasn't even attracted to her,

384
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,840
但跟她做爱的想法 却发展成了疯狂的执念
but the idea of it became this wild obsession for me.

393
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,920
天啊
Oh God.

395
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,560
有人伤害了你 对吧?
Someone hurt you, didn't they?

399
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,680
在我设想过的 玛莎有可能干出的所有疯狂事里
Out of all the things I expected Martha to do next,

400
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,120
修复好我崩坏的性能力绝对不在其列
fixing my broken libido wasn't one of them.

402
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,480
我也讨厌它的回归令泰瑞如此开心
And I hated how happy it made Teri too.

404
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,240
我已经什么都不知道了
I didn't know anything anymore,

405
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,920
不知这一切将如何收场 所以在肆虐的惶惑中
so, in a tailspin as to where this all might end,

406
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,240
我仿佛感觉再次受到了凌虐
I felt abused again.

407
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,560
可以确定的是 如今有了警方的介入 她不会傻到再轻举妄动了
Surely with the police now involved, she'd be foolish to do anything else.

408
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,640
你列好时间线了吗?
Have you put together a timeline?

410
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,720
还没有 抱歉 我...
Uh, not yet. Sorry, I... I...

411
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,120
我还没想好该怎么写
I haven't found the words.

412
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,080
没关系 等你写好了再交给我们就行
Well, no problem. Just get it to us when you can.

413
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,120
我们跟史考特女士谈过了
So we spoke to Ms. Scott.

414
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,440
她怎么说?
What did she say?

416
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,000
结果发现她出奇地配合
 well, she was surprisingly cooperative in the end.

417
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,400
真的吗?
Really?

418
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,960
她说她感到很羞愧 还表示愿意接受我们的帮助
She said she was embarrassed and went on to accept our offer of help.

419
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,600
事实上 自从那次谈话后 她已经去听了两节
In fact, she has attended two of our social-adjustment courses

420
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
我们提供的 社会适应课程?
since we last spoke to her. Social-adjustment courses?

422
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,280
通常是给长期服刑后 刑满释放的人员开设的
It's usually for ex-convicts who have done lengthy prison sentences,

423
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,200
但对惯犯也有帮助
but it helps with reoffenders as well.

424
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
她还说了别的什么吗?
So, did she say anything else?

425
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,680
没有会引人担忧的内容
Nothing that causes concern.

426
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
也没传递出任何信息吗?
She didn't, like, pass anything on?

427
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,480
我想不到有哪些不对劲
Nothing that comes to mind.

428
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,120
但她很生气 对吧? 我是说 她当时一定气炸了
But she was upset, right? I mean, she must have been upset.

429
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,880
没有 她其实接受得很好
No. No, she took it quite well, actually.

430
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,640
那这事就到此为止了?
So, that's it, then?

431
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,360
是的
That's it.

432
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,480
如果她再联系你 我们会把案件移交皇家检控署
If she contacts you again, we'll move the process on to the CPS,

433
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,160
他们会做出司法决策
who will decide the judicial outcome,

434
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,200
结果很可能是 法院会对她下达全面限制令
and likely result in you obtaining a full restraining order.

435
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,880
你可以喘口气了 唐尼
You can breathe out now, Donny.

436
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,080
什么? 她就坦然接受了?
So, what? She just accepted it?

437
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,120
是啊 很奇怪吧? 我以为她至少会嘴硬几句呢
Yeah. Strange, right? I at least thought she'd say something back.

438
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,640
再编造点东西什么的 但结果看来 她非常合作
You know, make shit up. But, apparently, she was very cooperative.

439
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,680
太诡异了
Weird.

440
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,120
还以为我们已经看透她了呢
You think you know someone.

441
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,040
是啊
Yeah.

442
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,600
怎么了?
What's wrong?

443
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,680
没有你期待的大决战 失望了?
Not the big showdown you were hoping for?

444
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,280
我不知道 只是感觉很奇怪 原来一直以来 她还是有自制力的
I don't know. It's just, like, odd that she had self-restraint all along.

445
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,200
让我不禁会想 也许她原本就没那么疯
Makes me think she wasn't all that mad to begin with.

446
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,520
现在你听起来才像个疯子
Now you're talking like the crazy one.

447
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,960
我才没疯 四万家律师事务所可不这么认为
I'm not crazy. 40,000 law firms say otherwise!

448
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,960
嘿 我们现在谈论的 好歹是个精神病人
Hey, this is still a mentally ill woman that we're talking about here.

449
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,880
好吧
Okay, okay.

450
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,280
我毕竟是一名治疗师
I'm still a therapist.

451
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,680
不能被人看见我放纵自己
I can't be seen indulging...

452
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,640
你的模仿太拙劣了 驯鹿宝贝 
...rank impressions, baby reindeer,

453
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,440
而且还用毫无根据的谎言诋毁我
baseless lies and slander.

454
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,040
这是什么鬼?
What was that?

455
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,480
你这是在模仿玛莎吗? 天哪
Was that... Was that a Martha impression? Wow.

456
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,040
谁打来的?
Who's that?

457
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
我妈妈
It's my mum.

458
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,720
快接吧 我很好奇 要评判男人的人品 从他对待母亲的方式就可见一斑
Get it. I'm intrigued. You can always judge a man by how he treats his mother.

459
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,120
你他妈的到底想怎样?
What the fuck do you want?

460
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,480
开玩笑的 我还没接呢
I'm only joking. I haven't picked up.

461
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,920
我晚点再回拨给她 今晚是属于我们的二人世界
I'll get back to her later. This night is for us.

462
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,280
来
Here.

463
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,920
敬新的开始
To new beginnings.

464
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,920
敬新的开始
To new beginnings.

465
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,400
- 你想好点什么了吗? - 还没 你呢 要点什么?
- Do you know what you're having? No idea. What are you getting?

466
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,280
我通常只会选 我知道名字该怎么念的菜品
I usually pick the only thing I can pronounce on the menu,

467
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,720
所以我就来份猪肘好了
so I think it's the ham hock for me.

468
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,280
第一条新语音信息 留言时间 28号 星期日 晚上8点28分
First new message, received Sunday 28th at 8:28 p.m.

469
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,600
你快接电话好吗? 我们到处给医院打电话
Will you pick up? We've been ringing every hospital

470
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,400
因为不知道你被送去了哪一家
to figure out which one you've been taken to.

471
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,240
问谁都说不知道 所以你能不能...
Nobody knows a thing, so if you would--

472
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,440
电话给我 我来说 儿子 快他妈的接电话
Give me that, will you? Son, pick up your bastard phone.

473
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,760
我们坐在这干着急 不知道该往哪走
We're sitting here wondering where the fuck to go.

474
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,640
听说你出车祸了 但我们问了半天
Nobody has any records of you anywhere,

475
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,920
没有人知道你在哪 也没有任何记录
or a car crash or anything we've been told.

476
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,720
告诉我们究竟发生了什么事
So tell us what's going on.

477
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,400
我们回拨给之前打电话来的那个人 也打不通
We can't get back through to the person who called either.

478
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,680
她叫什么名字来着?
What's her fucking name?

479
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,160
玛莎
Martha.

480
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,560
