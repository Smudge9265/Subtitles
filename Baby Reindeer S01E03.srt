1
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,040
{\an8}怦怦、怦怦、怦怦 我斤见了 小驯鹿 我听见了 

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,680
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,040
我在脸书上屏蔽了玛莎 然后跟酒吧请了一段时间的假
I blocked Martha on Facebook and then took some time off from the pub.

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,600
也许是内心抱有一丝侥幸
Maybe in the back of my mind,

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,520
只要我长时间不出现 她会因无聊而放弃
I hoped that if I disappeared long enough she might grow bored,

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,720
又或者我能淡忘发生的一切
or I might be able to forget what happened.

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,880
但在那之后的好几天 我依然能感受到她的触摸
But I still felt her grope for days afterwards.

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,880
以及她把我按在墙上时 脖子上的汗臭味
The smell of her neck sweat as she pressed me up against the wall.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,520
我为什么没有反抗?
And why did I freeze?

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,800
为什么放任一切发生?
Why did I just let it happen?

12
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,640
这一切感觉如此不真实
It didn't feel human.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,580
从头到尾都像一场噩梦
It never does.

15
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:00,840
{\an8}你介段时间都没去酒巴 小驯鹿 出什么事了?

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,840
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,200
这么晚还没睡呀
Ooh, you're up late.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,440
嗯 我睡不着
Uh, yeah. I... I couldn't sleep.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,720
周五的约会怎么样?
How was your date Friday?

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,680
噢 不太顺利
Oh, not the best.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,200
听着
Look,

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,560
希望你不会因为以前跟我女儿交往过
I hope you don't feel like you can't bring people back here

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,480
就不好意思带人回来过夜
just because you used to date my daughter.

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,720
不 不是那样的 只是...
Oh, no. No, it's, uh... It's not that. It's just, um...

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,240
她在回家的路上把我甩了
She ditched me on the way home.

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,360
那也太混帐了
What a scumbag.

32
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,200
老实说 唐尼 这样的人 没了她更好
Honestly, Donny, you're better off without someone like that.

38
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,960
我知道不能再窝在家里 无视自身的问题了
I knew I couldn't sit inside anymore ignoring my problems,

39
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,840
所以我前往泰瑞家 决心要做一件
and so I headed round to Teri's, determined to do something

40
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,000
到目前为止最不计后果的事
which felt more reckless than any of my behavior so far.

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
{\an8}女王

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,320
我要告诉她真相
I was gonna tell her the truth.

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
你好?
Hello?

44
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,920
您好 请收快递
All right, mate. Delivery.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,320
喔 好的 来了
Oh, okay. Coming.

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,520
你搞什么呀 托尼?
What the hell, Tony?

48
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,680
听着 我知道我不是送货员 但我确实有东西要给你
Look, I know I'm not a delivery man, but I am delivering something.

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,600
什么?
What?

50
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,880
一句抱歉
An apology.

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,800
滚你妈的 俗套的混蛋
Oh, fuck off, you cheesy prick.

52
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,520
这个意思是我可以上去吗?
Does that mean I can come up?

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,720
我给你三分钟时间
You have three minutes.

54
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,000
其实我不叫托尼
My name's not Tony.

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,600
我就知道 你的真名是什么?
I knew it. What's your real name?

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,520
唐尼
It's Donny.

58
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,640
所以你能对跟踪狂说实话 对我却要用假名
Oh, so you can be honest with your stalker but not with me?

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,800
你对我说的有一句是真话吗?
I mean, is anything you told me true?

60
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,720
比如你那个超屌的建筑师的工作
Your ballsy fucking building job for one.

61
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,880
假的
No.

62
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,400
为什么?为什么说谎?
Why? Why lie?

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,240
不知道 大概是我心虚吧
I don't know. It... it... I just felt vulnerable, I guess.

64
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,960
伪装成另一个人 能让我感觉轻松自在些
It just helped me ease into it, you know, pretending to be someone else.

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,480
伪装成一个...怎么说呢
Someone, I don't know,

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,280
有男子气概的人
manly.

67
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,000
这真是我听过的最离谱的鬼话
That's, like, the craziest shit I've ever heard.

68
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,480
你他妈的脑子有病 知道吗?
You're fucking sick, you know that?

69
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,920
那么继续吧 你在哪儿工作?
So go on, where do you work?

70
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,000
- 一间酒吧 - 哪间酒吧?
- A pub. - Which pub?

71
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,560
你连这都说不出口
You can't even say that.

72
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,200
卡姆登区的心跳酒吧
The Heart in Camden.

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,280
你是干什么的?
What do you do?

74
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,280
我刚才不是告诉你了吗?
I just told you what I did.

75
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,000
没人会甘心在酒吧工作 你的规划是什么?长远打算?
Nobody wants to work at a bar. What's the plan? The big picture?

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,160
你希望自己十年后成为怎样的人?
Where do you wanna be in ten years' time?

77
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,320
一名谐星
A comedian.

78
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,600
喔 那很好呀
Oh, that's good.

80
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,960
这件事肯定是个很好的笑料吧
I'm sure this is a right laugh.

81
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,360
是不是? 跟我逢场作戏 好搜集素材?
Is that it? Doing all of this for a bit of material?

82
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,920
什么? 不 泰瑞 我绝不会做那种事
What? No. Teri, I'd never do that.

83
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,320
我不相信你 你说的我一个字都不信
I don't believe you. I don't believe anything you say.

84
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,400
还有
And guess what?

85
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,360
三分钟时间到了 混蛋 滚出我的家
Time's up, dickhead. Get the fuck out my house.

86
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,000
你听我说
Listen.

89
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,960
{\an8}编辑资料

91
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,680
{\an8}托尼

{\an8}谐星

97
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,760
{\an8}“谐星”

99
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,200
唐尼
Donny! Donny!

100
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,800
过来 和烹饪小组的大伙儿打个招呼
Come here. Come say hello to the cooking group.

101
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
他来了
There he is!

102
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,000
你们有正经做过料理吗?
Have you guys done any cooking whatsoever?

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,400
- 我们还在研究酒焰灼烧法 - 对
- We're still on the flambé.

104
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,160
这周有什么收获? 有新人加入吗?
Who've you got? Any new recruits?

105
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,040
对了 有的 这是宝儿
Oh, yes. This is Beau.

106
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,440
- 宝儿是职业油漆工 - 你好 宝儿
- Beau is a painter by trade. - Hello, Beau.

107
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,120
还有希拉 但是天啊 抱歉 我忘记你是做什么的了
And this is Sheila. But, oh God, sorry, I've forgotten what it is you do.

108
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,000
我是律师
I'm a lawyer.

109
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,320
{\an8}驯鹿宝贝 如果你不相我去你家

110
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,640
{\an8}未什么还总走运河那条路回去?

111
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,720
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

112
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
{\an8}驯鹿宝贝》

113
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,440
初到伦敦时
When I first came to London, 

114
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
我和当时的女朋友琪莉一起 
I moved with my then girlfriend, Keeley,

115
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,520
搬进了她妈妈的家 一边借住一边找房子
into her mother's home while we tried to find a place to build a life together.

117
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,440
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

118
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,200
但原本计划的两周延长到了六个月
But an intended stopgap of two weeks turned into six months,

119
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
再又到一年
turned into one year,

120
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,600
直到她骂我性冷淡 然后搬了出去
turned into her calling me an emotionless prick and moving out

121
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,320
我都没能成功勃起过一次
before I could manage an erection.

122
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,360
在那之后 令人啼笑皆非又难以置信的是
So then, in an irony I couldn't quite believe,

123
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,880
我俨然跟他的母亲过成了两口子
I found myself married to her mother.

124
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,000
琪莉搬出去之后不久
Shortly after Keeley moved out,

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,640
丽兹的大儿子不幸死于一场登山事故
Liz's eldest son died in an abseiling accident,

126
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,360
刚面临新的生活状况 就遇上这样的神展开 简直太硬核了
which was about as intense a way into a new living situation as could be.

127
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,840
天啊 真抱歉
Oh my God, I'm... I am so sorry.

128
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,320
不 没关系
No, no, it's fine.

129
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,520
- 你确定吗? 我可以... - 没事
- Are you sure? I mean, I...- Yeah.

130
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,920
好的 好吧 我冲杯咖啡就走
Okay. Um... All right. I... I'll be very quick.

131
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,000
我从这边绕过去
I'll go round this way.

133
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,360
你还好吗? 看见你真好
You all right? Good to see you.

134
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,560
三分钟就好
For three minutes.

135
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,480
有时我确实会怀疑 是不是因为恰好在那时痛失爱子
And I do sometimes question whether the timing of Liz's son's passing

136
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,040
使得丽兹把我当成了儿子的替身
lead her to see me as an extension of him.

137
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,000
仿佛他出了一趟远门 回来时变得有点更像苏格兰人
Like he left the house one day and came back a little more Scottish,

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,720
多了些神经质 但恕我直言
a little more neurotic, and, dare I say,

139
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,280
山地绳降的技术也变强了
a little better at abseiling.

140
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,440
这个给你穿吧 在阁楼找到的
I got this. Found it in the loft.

141
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,440
- 不 我不能穿 - 他品位可好了
- Oh, no, I couldn't. - He dressed well.

142
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,160
确实 但我真的不能穿 感觉不太合适
He did. But, honestly, I couldn't. It wouldn't feel right.

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
你先拿着吧 好好考虑一下
Why don't I leave this with you? Think it through.

144
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,600
丽兹 我真的不能收下这件外套
Honestly, Liz, I absolutely cannot accept this coat.

145
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,040
多么离奇的生活状况呀
It was a strange living situation,

146
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,920
跟我前女友那位离过两次婚 且刚经历丧子之痛的母亲捆绑在一起
to be shacked up with the twice-divorced, grieving mother of my ex-girlfriend.

147
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,320
但最终 我渐渐开始庆幸有她的陪伴
But in the end, I really grew to value her presence in my life.

148
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
她的乐观和积极正好能给
She had the kind of boundless positivity

149
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,120
在难以言说的困境中挣扎的人 传递无穷的正能量
reserved only for those fighting the most unspeakable circumstances.

150
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,640
所以当琪莉发现我打算留下时
Therefore, when Keeley found out about my plans to stay,

151
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,920
她同意了 但有一个条件
she let me, on one condition.

152
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,920
我绝不能把麻烦惹上门
That I never bring chaos to her mother's door.

153
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,320
老实说 我真不明白你是怎么做到的
I don't know how you do it. Honestly, I don't.

154
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
做到什么 姐妹?
Do what, hen?

155
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,600
这么晚不睡 居然连口酒都不喝
Stay up this late without so much as a tipple.

156
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,760
我还是不喝酒的好 平常就已经够疯狂了
I'm better without it. Crazy enough as it is, me.

157
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
我老爸以前常说
My old man used to say

158
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,720
哪怕滴酒不沾 我也整天像个醉鬼一样
I'm a full-time drunk without touching a drop.

159
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,000
我懂你
I know that feeling.

160
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,400
她真不错 我喜欢她
She's good. I like her.

161
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,760
- 我给你把酒满上? - 今天该告一段落了吧
- Top-up? - I think we should maybe wrap up.

162
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,280
请给我一杯健怡可乐 谢谢
A Diet Coke, please.

163
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,640
喝那么多咖啡因 你会兴奋得整晚睡不着觉吧
You'll be bouncing off the walls with all that caffeine.

164
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,600
我倒想呢
Hopefully.

165
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,800
但要兴奋起来 我可能需要一点帮助 好吧?
Might need a bit of help bouncing, mind.

166
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,120
丽兹 我觉得今晚就到此为止吧
Listen, uh, Liz, I think maybe we should call it.

167
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,480
我今天起太早了 需要好好睡一觉
I'm... I'm up early, and I need... I need a decent night's sleep.

168
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,280
我可以留下陪你
I could stay here.

169
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,560
欢迎之至
You'd be so welcome.

170
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,960
这里以前是出租房 有很多空房间
This is an old lodging house. Plenty of rooms to spare.

171
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,800
我觉得最好还是别让玛莎留宿吧
I actually think it's best if Martha doesn't stay tonight.

173
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,960
她叫希拉 天哪
Her name's Sheila! Oh my God!

174
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,840
你怎么就醉了?
You're supposed to be the sober one.

175
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,320
希拉 我想你一定会保持安静 不吵着这位唐尼小哥睡觉的吧
Sheila, I assume I can trust you to stay quiet for young Donny here.

176
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,360
当然 就算想闹出动静 我也会忍住的
Oh, absolutely. I'll bite my lip if I think of making any noise.

177
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,840
好极了 那就这么定了 我去帮你铺床
Great. That's settled, then. I'll pad you out a bed.

179
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,800
唐尼 你给希拉泡杯茶助眠吧?
Donny, why don't you make Sheila a nice cup of tea for beddies?

180
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,120
你现在马上给我离开这里
You're to leave here, right now.

181
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,240
不 我要留下过夜
No. I'm staying the night.

182
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,040
否则就太失礼了 我的朋友丽兹正帮我铺床呢
It'd be rude not to. My new friend Liz is fastening me up a bed.

183
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,280
她不是你的朋友 你也不能留下
She's not your friend, and you're not fucking staying.

184
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,120
别对我这么凶
Don't get stuffy with me.

185
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,160
你该庆幸 
You're lucky I'm still interested

186
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,560
我被你在脸书上屏蔽了还肯来找你
after you pissed off from the pub and blocked me on Facebook.

187
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,400
我现在不想说这个 你要是再这么乱来
I'm not talking about this. If you continue this bullshit any longer,

189
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,040
我就报警了
I'll call the police.

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,760
你敢 我是律师
You wouldn't dare. I'm a lawyer.

191
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,000
干我这行是有行事规范的
I've got certain standards to live up to.

192
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,120
我可不想警察跑来无事生非
I don't want the police making waffles out of nothing.

193
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,160
那就快走 以后也别来这个烹饪课
Then leave. Stay away from this cooking class.

194
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,520
别接近丽兹 别靠近这所房子
Stay away from Liz, and stay away from this house.

195
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,080
清楚了吗?
Is that clear?

196
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,520
好的 那好
Okay. All right.

197
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,160
说吧 你想怎么...
What's it gonna--

198
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,240
{\an8}别报警 我莱时碰巧她们在聚会

199
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,400
{\an8}旦我对亨饪没兴趣 所以去它的巴 我点外卖就好

200
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,560
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

201
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,080
我担惊受怕了一整晚
I spent all night panicking,

202
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,120
玛莎知道了我的住处 会做出什么事来?
thinking of the things Martha could do now she knew where I lived.

203
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,000
她可能会成天过来打转
She could come over all the time,

204
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,160
在走廊里缠着我
hound me in the corridors of my home,

205
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,520
大半夜溜上我的床
sneak into my bed in the dead of the night.

206
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,040
到时候会怎样?
And what would happen then?

207
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,720
我真该当机立断去找警察 可我却决定先找她谈谈
I should have gone to the police, but I decided to speak to her first,

208
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,800
警告她 再敢出现在我家
tell her that if she ever came to the house again,

209
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,880
就让她后悔莫及
there would be absolutely no going back.

210
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,400
但她一直没有出现
But she never showed.

211
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,200
她知道那是我返工后第一次上班
She knew it was my first shift back.

212
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,680
这样就让她从我的生活中消失了吗?
Was that all it took to remove her from my life?

213
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,080
就凭那天威胁她说要报警?
One threat about calling the police?

214
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,600
一切都感觉太简单、太轻松
It all just seemed too simple, too easy,

215
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,520
太...
too...

216
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
见鬼
Oh shit!

218
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,200
可恶
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

219
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,000
我去开门
I'll get this.

221
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,720
我告诉过你不要来这里
I told you not to come here.

222
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,120
我觉得你对此没有发言权吧
I don't think you have any say in the matter.

223
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
琪莉
Keeley.

224
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
你怎么...
What are you...

225
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
- 你怎么来了? - 怎么 我不能回我妈妈家吗?
- What are you doing here? - What, at my family home?

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,240
- 我不知道你要来 - 是我让妈妈别告诉你的
- I didn't know you had plans to be down. - I told my mum not to tell you.

227
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,000
我不想小题大做
I didn't wanna make a big deal out of it.

228
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,520
但看你这副表情 大概是事与愿违了
But judging by your facial expressions, probably too late for that.

229
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,480
不 我只是...你打算待多久?
No, no, I just, um... I just, uh... How long are you staying for?

230
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,920
- 想待多久就待多久 - 是啊 不 当然
- As long as I bloody like. - Yeah, yeah. No, of course.

232
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,320
对 这是一个很严肃的问题 你女朋友是个神经病
Yeah, well, this is serious. Your girlfriend is a psycho.

233
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,440
她不停在脸书上联系我 缠着我不放
She keeps contacting me on Facebook. She will not leave me alone.

234
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,680
我都开始担心她会来找我了
I'm starting to worry I'm gonna bump into her somewhere.

235
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,920
你能跟她谈谈吗?
Can you talk to her?

236
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,400
- 她不是我女朋友 - 那她是谁?
- She's not my girlfriend. - Who is she, then?

237
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,920
你得把这事解决了
You need to sort this out.

238
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,960
为什么是我? 这事跟我没关系
Why me? I don't have anything to do with this.

239
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,760
胡说 肯定是你做了什么 才惹上这麻烦的
Bullshit. You would have done something to bring this on.

240
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,120
又来了 什么都怪在我头上
Here we go. Blame me like you always do. 

241
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,560
对 就是怪你 你就爱没事找事
Yeah, I do blame you. You love drama.

242
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,280
只要能摆脱一潭死水的生活 你什么都干得出来
Anything to take you away from the stasis that is your own life.

243
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,000
哇 不错嘛 你上了那么久的心理学研究生课程
Wow, wow. It's great to see you putting that psychology postgrad to good use

244
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,400
可算是学以致用了
after all this time.

245
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,720
我还以为你在花店工作 是在浪费才华呢
There was me thinking you were wasting it working in a flower shop.

246
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,240
她再这么骚扰我的话 我就要告诉我妈了
If she keeps pestering me, I'm gonna tell my mum.

247
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,200
那你立马就会被扫地出门 没有便宜房租蹭了
And then you'll be out of here before you can say mates' rates.

248
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,640
{\an8}好讨厌琪莉那臭婊子 真是的 我到哪逗能见到她

249
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,680
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

250
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,000
现在玛莎每天都守在外面
Every day now, Martha would be outside.

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,960
这颗定时炸弹不知何时会要了我的命
This ticking time bomb on my life.

252
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,560
哪怕我一大早出门 她也已经守在那里了
I would leave first thing in the morning, and she would be there.

253
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,440
我爱你 小奶头 上班时要想我哦
I love you, nipple. Think of me at work today.

255
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,080
有时我会忙到深夜十一二点才回家
Then I would come back, sometimes as late as 11 or 12 at night,

256
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,520
而她依然守在那里
and she would still be there.

257
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,800
工作顺利吗 小驯鹿? 有没有想我?
How was your shift, reindeer? Did you think of me?

258
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,800
真想不通这对她有什么好处 她再没靠近过我
I never understood what she got from it. She never approached me.

259
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,560
也再没有进过这栋房子
She never came to the house again.

260
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,720
每次丽兹路过 她都会避开
She avoided Liz whenever she passed.

261
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,720
她每天等待十五六个小时
It was all catcalls and snatched glimpses,

262
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,360
只为一场转瞬而逝的相遇 远远地喊上几句话 看上我几眼
as she devoted 15, 16-hour days to a fleeting encounter.

263
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,680
讲个笑话吧 笑笑骨 让我乐一乐
Tell us a joke, funny bones. Make me smile.

265
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,600
但很快 随着时间的流逝 气温逐渐下降
But soon, as time wore on and the temperature dropped,

266
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
我注意到了玛莎的一个变化
I noticed a change in Martha

267
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,920
她开始就这么怔怔地注视着虚空
as she descended into this staring.

269
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,000
玛莎
Martha.

270
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,920
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

274
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,520
然后那害我落到
It all just came back

275
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,120
如此田地的同情心 又回来了
to those same feelings of empathy which got me here.

282
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,120
天哪 玛莎 你在这外面坐了多久了?
Jesus Christ, Martha, how long have you been sitting out here for?

283
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,480
我这里有纸巾
Here. I've got a tissue somewhere.

284
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,920
给
There.

285
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,120
好吧
All right.

286
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,520
我来帮你...
Here, let me, um...

287
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,920
你整晚这么坐下去会冻死的
You're gonna catch your death if you sit out here all night.

288
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,560
我送你回家 好吗?
I'm gonna take you back to yours, okay?

289
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,600
我的房东有车 我可以...
My landlady has a car, and I'll...

290
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
开车送你回去
I'll drive you.

291
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,120
好了 起来吧
All right, come on.

292
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,320
来 我们走
Here. Let's go.

293
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,160
好了 去坐会儿吧
Here. Sit down.

294
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,640
我给你泡杯茶
Gonna make you a cup of tea.

295
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,560
你得尽快让身子暖和起来
It's important you heat up as soon as possible.

298
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,240
{\an8}梦中情人

301
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,640
{\an8}玛莎·史考特 法学学士一等学位

302
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
给 小心烫
Here. It's hot.

303
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,080
玛莎 你不能再守在 我家对面的那个公交车站了
Martha, you have to stop hanging around that bus stop on my road.

304
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,960
为什么?
Why?

306
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,400
因为你之所以那么做 只是因为我家离那里不到30米
Because you're only there because my house is 30 yards away.

307
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,360
你住在我朋友隔壁
You live next door to my friend.

308
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,560
那你为什么会待在车站 而不是你朋友家里?
Then why are you there and not next door at your friend's?

309
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,120
玛莎 求你了 别这样
Martha, please, don't do this.

310
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,680
现在的住所对我来说很重要 我住不起其他地方
My home means a great deal to me, and I can't afford to be anywhere else.

312
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
见鬼
Fuck.

313
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,600
哎呀 你怎么哭了 小奶头?
Oh no. Why are you crying, nipple?

314
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,800
不 我没哭 我只是...
No, I'm not fucking crying. I just...

315
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,160
出什么事了? 告诉我
What's wrong? Tell me.

316
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,800
是你 玛莎 问题就出在你
You, Martha. You're what's wrong.

317
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,760
那我怎样才能帮上你呢 小驯鹿? 你需要什么?
What can I do to help though, reindeer? What... what do you need?

318
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,680
空间
Space.

319
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
空间
Space.

321
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,760
你想远离我?
Fr... from me?

322
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
你想分手吗?
From us?

323
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,520
你在胡说什么啊? 我们根本没在一起过 真他妈见鬼
Oh, what are you talking about? There is no us! Fucking hell.

324
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,440
无论我跟你说什么
I can say anything to you, can't I,

325
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,160
你都只会选择性地听自己想听的话
and you'll just pick and choose the bits you want to hear.

326
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,680
瞧你这副样子
I mean, look at you,

327
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,240
这么看着我 就好像...
staring at me like...

328
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
好像什么?
Like what?

329
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,320
我是说...
I mean...

330
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,840
你真的认为我们在交往 是吗?
you believe it, don't you?

331
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,240
玛莎
Martha.

332
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,200
我要跟你分手
I'm breaking up with you.

334
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,760
不
Oh no.

335
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,760
不要啊
Oh no.

336
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,720
不要 求你了 别跟我分手
Oh no, please. No, don't.

337
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,280
不要分手
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

338
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
求你了
Please.

339
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,640
- 我不会再去那里了 - 不 别这样好吗?玛莎
- I'll stop, I'll stop. - No, don't do that, Martha, okay?

340
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,080
听我说 好吗? 你听我说
- Don't. Just listen to me, okay? Listen. - Oh no.

341
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,120
别把这当成一种失去 把它视为收获吧
Don't think of this as something you lost. Think of it as something you gained.

342
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,960
如果你现在放手
If you stop now

343
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,440
再也别联系我
and never contact me again, 

344
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,160
还能留下美好的回忆 不是吗?
it's almost been perfect, hasn't it?

345
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,680
一段耐人寻味的 童话般的回忆
This fairy tale to look back on.

346
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,640
但要不想让童话破灭
But for it to remain a fairy tale,

347
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,520
你现在就得注重分手后的界限
you now need to respect the boundaries of the breakup.

348
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,640
你不想破坏童话的结局 对吧?
You wouldn't wanna spoil that fairy-tale ending, would you?

349
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,080
不想
No.

350
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,560
不想
No.

351
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,120
我不会的 弗兰基
I wouldn't, Frankie.

352
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,200
我不会破坏我们曾经拥有的一切
I won't do nothing to harm what we had.

354
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,600
{\an8}失落、空嘘... 我知道你也系认真的 你的眼神...

355
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,440
{\an8}看来介次要真的说再见了

356
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,520
{\an8}我爱你 小驯鹿 泥永远在我心里

357
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,080
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

358
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,280
好的 各位 听好了
Okay, guys. All right, listen up.

359
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,520
欢迎进入半决赛 你们每人有五分钟的表演时间
Welcome to the semifinals. You each have five minutes.

360
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,800
红灯会在计时结束前15秒开始闪烁
The red light will flash 15 seconds before the end,

361
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,520
谁超过了指定的时间 就会被取消资格
and if you go over your allotted time, you will be disqualified.

362
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,280
- 这位是主持人格兰达 - 大家好
- Now, Glenda here is your compère. - Sup, guys?

363
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,040
你们有任何要求 或者不明白的地方 都可以找她
So any requests, specific introductions, she's your man.

364
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,840
好了 祝各位好运
Right. Good luck, everyone.

365
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,240
我在心里将这场演出当作了 我所有问题的答案
I had built this gig up in my head as the answer to all my problems.

366
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,800
只要晋级决赛 
Getting to the final might be enough

367
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,200
或许我就能走出过去几年的阴影
to drag me out of the hell of the past few years.

368
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,840
没有了玛莎的纠缠 我真的感觉前路已经畅通无阻了
And with Martha gone, it really felt like there was nothing in my way.

369
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
直到...
That was until...

370
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,760
泰瑞
Teri.

372
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,280
- 搞什么呀? - 不客气
- What the hell? - Warm welcome.

373
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,840
不 只是...
No, no, it's just...

374
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,680
我已经好几周没见到你了
I haven't seen you for weeks.

375
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,200
- 你来这里做什么? - 来观看演出
- What are you doing here? - Coming to see the show.

376
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
- 你开玩笑的吧? - 不能更认真了
- You can't be serious. Deadly.

377
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,280
我想做个彻底的了结 
If anything's gonna give me closure,

378
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,120
看你在好几百人面前一败涂地 这方法再合适不过了
it's seeing you fail spectacularly in front of hundreds of people.

380
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,480
20个人够吗?
Will 20 do?

381
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,960
抱歉 这些是?
And, sorry, these are?

383
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,200
我的朋友
Oh. My friends.

384
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,480
他们来防止我再次因为某个渣男
They're here to stop me sliding into a familiar pattern

385
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,800
而做出各种丢脸的事情
of shame-based behavior with horrible men.

386
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,760
幸会
Nice to meet you.

387
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,960
好吧 要说我先前没觉得紧张 现在我真的紧张起来了
Well, if I wasn't nervous before, I am now.

388
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,840
很好 我们可是很难取悦的哦
Good. We're very hard to please.

389
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,360
快来 哥们 我要开门了
Come on, bro. I need to open the doors.

390
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,040
好的 抱歉 我马上过去 好吗? 很快就好
Yeah, sorry. I'll... I'll be right up, okay? I'll be two seconds, yeah?

391
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,680
抱歉 我也不知为何刚才说要留下 我得上去了 祝你们愉快
Sorry, I don't know why I opted to stay. I'm gonna go too. Enjoy the show.

392
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,440
所以爸爸 如果你在看演出...
So, Dad, if you're watching this...

393
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,560
- 天哪 真要命 天啊 - ...穿条裤子吧
- Oh, Jesus. Oh, fucking hell. Jesus. - ...put on some trousers.

394
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,080
待会儿要我介绍一下你吗?
You want an introduction?

395
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,320
要的 你能说我有点疯癫吗?
Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. Can you introduce me as a little bit mad?

396
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,160
给观众一点心理准备 因为我的演出有些与众不同
It might help set up the audience for something a little bit different.

397
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,000
当然 下一个就到你了 祝你好运 伙计
Sure. You're on next. Good luck, mate.

398
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,160
{\an8}好的 谢谢

399
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,000
- 好样的 很棒的表演 - 怎么样 精彩吗 女士们先生们?
- Well done. That was great. How good was that?

400
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,800
好的 接下来这位艺人真是个疯子
Okay. Now, your next act is mental.

401
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,640
他一直在后台跟踪骚扰我们 大伙儿都吓得够呛
He's been stalking about backstage, freaking us all out.

402
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,600
这也太夸张了
That's too much.

403
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,920
所以 大伙儿最好看紧自己的女儿...
So you're gonna have to lock up your daughters.

404
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,320
她把我说成个变态了
Makes me sound like a pervert.

405
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,920
- ...让我们欢迎他上台... - 见鬼
Please welcome to the stage... - Fuck's sake!

406
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,000
- ...唐尼·邓恩  - 好吧 来了
...Donny Dunn! - All right, yeah.

407
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,840
对 那个...
Yeah, that's...

408
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,400
对 抱歉 不用看那么紧的
Uh, yeah, sorry. Uh, leave those doors unlocked.

409
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,160
这不是玩笑
That's... Yep, that's not a joke.

410
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,080
就是那个...我不会跟踪你们的女儿 这话说得我像是个...
It's just... I'm not after your daughters. That makes me sound like a... a...

411
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
我不是变态
I'm not a pervert.

412
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,960
其实我觉得这句话很奇怪 "看紧你们的女儿"
I've always found that phrase weird. "Lock up your daughters."

413
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,040
难道要把全城的女人关起来 而不去解决那个变态吗?
Like they lock up all the women in town, instead of dealing with the one pervert.

414
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,040
结果不是适得其反吗?
Talk about counterproductive.

415
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,640
好吧 我假设那是个变态 他也有可能
I... I assume he's a pervert anyway. I mean, he could be, like, a... like a...

416
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,920
是个连环杀人犯 或者对年轻姑娘
serial killer or something, you know, with a

417
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,080
有特殊嗜好的
particular penchant for, uh,

418
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,080
禽兽
young girls.

419
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,280
所以 对 我不会跟踪你们的女儿 只是想事先声明这点
So, yeah, not after your daughters. Uh, just wanna make that clear up top.

420
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,880
我来自苏格兰 所以我渴望的是你们的糕点
I'm from Scotland originally, so it's your pastries I'm after.

422
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,120
我知道我听起来不像苏格兰人 
I know I don't sound Scottish,

423
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,320
但作为证据 瞧我这副德行吧
but if you need proof, just look at the state of me.

424
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,880
我才刚满16岁哦
I've just turned 16.

425
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,240
好的 很好 对 好了 我要开始搞笑了
All right, good. Yeah. All right, let's do some jokes.

426
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,400
唐尼·邓恩
Donny Dunn.

427
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,200
三个礼拜前 我女朋友来找我
So three weeks ago, my girlfriend came up to me,

428
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,480
她说想试试跟我玩双修
and she says she really wants to try tantric sex,

429
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,080
就是那种延迟性高潮的房中术
the art of delaying an orgasm.

430
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,080
我回答说:"嘿 我跟你交往了五年
So I replied, "Hey, I've been going out with you for five years,

431
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,520
你一次高潮都没到过
and you haven't come once."

432
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,080
还想要我怎样?"
"What more do you want from me?"

433
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,320
唐尼·邓恩
Donny Dunn.

434
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,960
两周前 我女朋友来找我说
Two weeks ago, my girlfriend came up to me and said,

435
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,800
"我觉得我们俩不合适"
"I just think we're not working as lovers."

436
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,840
我回答道:"噢 拜托
To which I replied, "Oh, come on."

437
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,160
之前你不想做我表妹了 也是这么说的"
"That's what you said about the cousins thing."

438
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,960
唐尼·邓恩
Donny Dunn.

439
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,240
那之后又过了一周 她来找我说
Then one week after that, she came up to me and she said,

440
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,960
"我想离开你"
"I'm thinking of leaving you."

441
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,800
我的回答是
To which I replied,

442
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,640
"求你了 不要"
"Please. No."

443
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,160
唐尼·邓恩
Donny Dunn.

445
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,000
好吧 对了 我们来上道具吧 好的
All right, um, yeah. Let's do some... Let's do some prop stuff. All right.

446
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,440
♪ 钟情于你 ♪ 
♪ Especially for you ♪

447
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,280
♪ 多想你知道 我饱受煎熬 ♪ 
♪ I wanna let you know What I was going through ♪

448
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,640
♪ 分开的日子里 不停思念你 ♪ 
♪ All the time we were apart I thought of you ♪

449
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,240
谢谢 那我继续了
Thanks for that. Moving on.

450
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,400
我好想你
I miss you.

451
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,400
我也想你 陌生的女士
Um, I miss you too, random stranger.

452
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,200
我才不是什么陌生人 我是你的前女友
I'm not a random stranger. I'm your ex.

453
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,400
别这么无情呀
Don't be so cruel.

454
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,480
你刚才说的前女友是谁?
Who's that girl you were talking about?

455
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,440
是你脸书上那个琪莉吗?
Is that Keeley from your Facebook?

457
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,520
不 那是我虚构出来的人物 有一种东西叫小说 知道吗?
No, it's a little thing called fiction, actually.

458
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
你看《权力的游戏》时
Just so you know, when you watch Game of Thrones,

459
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,720
知道里面那些不是真的龙吧?
those aren't real dragons, you do realize that?

460
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,160
真搞不懂他们为什么都在笑 你讲的笑话烂透了
I don't know why they're all laughing. You're absolutely shite.

462
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,680
女士们先生们 我来给你们介绍一下好了
Okay, just to give you some context, ladies and gentlemen,

463
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,600
她叫...
this is, uh...

464
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,400
她叫玛莎 是个跟踪狂 最近盯上我了 跟玛莎打个招呼吧
This is Martha, my stalker. Say hello to Martha.

465
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,320
你胆敢这么说我
Don't you dare say that to me!

466
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,360
我可是付了钱来看演出的客人 你竟敢暗骂我动机不纯
I'm a paying customer. How dare you insinuate mixed intentions!

467
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,560
立刻向我道歉
You apologize to me right now.

469
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,280
见鬼 谁把精神病院的门给打开了?
Fucking hell. Who unlocked the doors to Broadmoor?

470
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,640
你不能说我是跟踪狂
You can't call me a stalker.

471
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,960
你才是大晚上在我家外面 鬼鬼祟祟转悠的人
You're the one creeping round my house at night.

472
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,040
透过我的窗户往里偷看
Peering in through my windows.

473
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,600
给我发电子邮件 求我让你插我的小菊花
Sending me emails begging for my bumhole.

474
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,320
我真的不知道她在说什么
I... I... I genuinely have no idea what she's talking about.

475
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,440
你知道
Yes, you do.

476
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,760
我可以给他们看
I'll show them.

477
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,440
- 他知道我在说什么 - 我们能请她出去吗?
- He does know what I'm talking about. - Can we get her out?

478
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,320
- 看 这里 - 谁来帮帮忙?
- Someone? - Look. There.

479
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,200
我不知道那是什么东西
I don't know what that is.

480
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,520
抱歉 麻烦把她赶出去好吗? 行吗?
Look, sorry, can we get her out, please? Yep?

481
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,840
看 一封邮件 上面写着肛交
Look, an email. Anal sex, it says.

482
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,840
这里 看见了吗? 看 肛交
There, see? Look. Anal.

483
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,600
- 来吧 亲爱的 我带你出去 - 这上面写的肛交
Come on, darling. Out we go. Anal sex, it says.

484
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,080
- 别用你的手碰我 - 我们走
- Don't you put your hands on me. Out we go.

485
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,000
无论如何你们都没有权利碰我
You're not allowed to put your hands on me. Under no circumstances.

486
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,320
不 他是个喜欢肛交的变态
No. He's a bumhole lover, this one.

487
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,200
一个下流的肛交癖
A proper dirty little bumhole lover.

488
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,040
一文不值的酒吧小侍应 喜欢肛交的混蛋猥琐男
A filthy little two-bit, barman, bumhole bastard!

489
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,320
别碰我
Don't touch me!

490
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,520
真是去哪都不能带上我妈呀
Can't take my mum anywhere.

491
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,040
见鬼
Fuck!

492
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,480
泰瑞 见鬼
Teri. Oh fuck.

493
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,920
快进来
Get in. Get in, quick. Quick.

494
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,200
- 那就是玛莎吗? - 对
- Was that Martha? - Yeah.

495
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,360
- 她真是疯了 - 我知道 我们快走吧
- That was nuts. - I know. We need to get out of here.

496
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,960
我想见见她
- I wanna meet her.

497
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,520
- 你在开玩笑吧? - 没开玩笑 我想见她
- You're not serious? - I am. I wanna meet her.

498
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,360
不 泰瑞 我劝你还是算了吧
No, Teri. That is not a good idea.

499
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,200
你想想看 我是一名治疗师 我可以开导她
It is. Think about it. I'm a therapist. I can get through to her.

500
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,440
你想想看吧 她是个疯子 那种人是没法沟通的
Think about it. She's insane. There's no getting through to her.

501
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,080
你跟我一起从后面下去
You'll have to come down the back way with me.

502
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,680
就当是为了我 好吗?
Just do this for me, yeah?

503
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,440
好吧 胆小鬼
Fine. Loser.

504
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,320
感觉有点滑稽 你居然害怕一个中年女人
It's kinda comical, you being scared of a middle-aged woman.

505
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,480
先别忙着笑 我也很怕大楼后方废弃的大房间
Wait until you hear about my phobia of massive, abandoned fucking back rooms.

506
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,520
- 小驯鹿? - 见鬼
- Reindeer? - Oh shit!

507
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,440
该死
Shit.

508
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,480
该死
Shit!

509
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,720
{\an8}你岗才是跟别人在一起吗?

510
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,480
{\an8}iPhone发送

511
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,440
- 天哪 - 真他妈见鬼
- Oh my God. - Fucking hell.

512
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,080
我整个人都在发抖
I'm, like, shaking.

513
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,480
天啊 她好可怕
Jesus. She's terrifying.

514
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,920
你觉得她看到我们了吗?
Do you think she saw us?

515
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,680
- 希望没有 - 真要命
- I hope not. - Fucking hell.

517
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,680
要去喝一杯吗?
Shall we, uh... Shall we get a drink, maybe?

518
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,280
我不知道
I don't know.

519
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,440
我其实没打算跟你来这里的
I didn't really plan on being here with you.

520
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,640
再给我一次机会吧 求你了
Look, just give me one more chance, please.

521
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,840
问题不是我想不想给你机会 而是...
Look, it's not about me giving you another chance. It's just...

522
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,200
我真的不想被人看见 我跟演出上那个蹩脚谐星在一起
I don't really wanna be seen with the shit comedian from the show.

524
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,160
你可以坐在我后面那桌 
You can always sit on the table behind me

525
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,160
背对着我说话
and talk to me over your shoulder if you'd like.

526
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,320
是啊 你就喜欢玩那套 对吧?
Yeah, you'd love that, wouldn't you?

527
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,160
天哪 刚才的演出简直是灾难
Oh, Jesus, that gig was brutal.

528
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,520
是啊 但其实原本还挺顺利的
Yeah. It was going so well too.

529
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,000
要不是中途被她打断 我真心觉得你有机会晋级的
I really would have fancied your chances, had she not interrupted.

530
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,240
- 你真会说话 - 那当然
- You always know the right thing to say. - Mm-hmm.

531
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,720
你为什么会留下来找我?
So, what made you stick around?

532
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,720
看见你在台上饱受煎熬
Seeing you struggle up top.

533
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,040
我真想冲上去给你一个拥抱
I just wanted to come on stage, give you a hug,

534
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,200
告诉你找一份真正的工作
and tell you to get a real job.

535
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:26,080
而且我看见你修改了 网站上的个人信息 还有...
Also, I saw you changed your profile on the website, and...

536
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,320
我也不知道
I don't know.

537
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,400
我想着这也许值得让我再考虑一下
I thought that was maybe worth something.

538
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,200
你觉得 你能对我做过的事既往不咎吗?
Do you ever think that you'd be able to see past what I did?

539
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,760
不 大概不能
Mm, no. Probably not.

540
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,400
从现在起
It'll be the baseline

541
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,680
它会奠定我们每一次争吵的基调
for every single argument we have from now on.

542
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,440
大致上说就是 从今往后 永远都是我赢
I win, essentially, for the rest of time.

543
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,960
好啊 这我应该能接受
Yeah, I think I can live with that.

544
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,400
这个臭婊子是谁?
Who's the skank?

545
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,440
你一定就是玛莎了
You must be Martha.

546
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,160
他跟我说了很多关于你的事
I've heard so much about you.

547
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,520
- 我从来没听他提起过你 - 好吧 冷静点 玛莎
- I've heard fuck all about you. - All right. Calm down, Martha.

548
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,320
这该死的臭婊子是谁?
Who's the fucking skank?

549
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,200
泰瑞莎 她叫泰瑞莎
Teresa. Her name is Teresa.

550
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,920
唐尼 我想玛莎还需要更多信息
Donny, I think Martha's gonna need a little bit more information than that.

551
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,760
我知道你为什么这么做 但现在不是好时机
Teri, I get why you're doing this, but now is not the right time.

552
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,680
坐下 现在时机刚刚好
Sit down. It's exactly the right time.

553
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,600
- 别碰他 贱人 - 玛莎
- Don't you touch him, bitch! - Martha.

554
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,040
我对天发誓 你再碰他一下
I swear to God, you lay another finger on him,

555
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,080
我就撕了你的嘴 我说到做到
I'm gonna wipe that lip from you, mark my words.

556
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,480
说真的 我们出去吧 玛莎
Seriously. Let's step outside, Martha, okay?

557
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,800
老实说 唐尼 我本该问你有没有上过她
Honestly, Donny, I'd ask if you're fucking,

558
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,880
但我不认为你会把鸡鸡 塞进那么肮脏的地方
but I don't think you'd stoop so low as to put your dick somewhere this dirty.

559
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,360
- 你说"肮脏"是什么意思? - 你懂我的意思
- What do you mean, "dirty"? - You know what I mean.

560
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,800
好吧 我们大家都冷静一点 好吗?
Okay, I think we should all calm down a bit, yeah?

561
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,360
不好 除非你先告诉我
No, not until you tell me

562
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,640
这个高颧骨的外来骚货是谁
who the foreign tart with the high cheekbones is,

563
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,040
瞧她一脸 "你没有权利在这里叫嚣"的样子
acting like I've got no right to be here,

564
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,720
但这是我的国家 她才是无权出现在这里的人
when she's got no right to be in my fucking country!

565
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,320
好了 玛莎 请你冷静点
All right, Martha. Calm down.

566
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,520
- 你们没事吧? - 没事 我来处理
Everything all right? - I've got this.

567
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,360
你成天就爱跟这种人鬼混吗? 瘾君子 强奸犯 这种外来人
Is this the company you're keeping? Druggies and rapists, the lot of 'em.

568
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,280
我对天发誓 要是可以的话
I swear to God, if I had my way,

569
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,680
我肯定立马 把他们用来偷渡的小船打沉
I'd sink their boats on the horizon.

570
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,280
这个疯子的胡言乱语我已经听够了
You know what? I'm getting bored of this now.

571
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,760
所以唐尼 跟她直说了吧 你在跟我约会
So, Donny, why don't you just tell her that you're on a date with me

572
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,440
请她滚开
and she needs to fuck off?!

573
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,560
婊子
Whore.

574
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,280
臭婊子
Whore!

575
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,600
该死的婊子
Fucking whore!

576
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,560
你这肮脏的小婊子
You're a nasty, nasty little whore!

577
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,400
- 玛莎 别闹了 - 死贱人
Martha, come on! - Fucking skank!

579
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,280
- 该死的丑八怪  - 玛莎
- You fucking ugly bitch! - Martha!

580
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,640
放开她 玛莎
Let go, Martha!

581
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,520
靴子
Boots!

582
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,080
住手 玛莎 冷静
Stop, Martha! Calm down!

583
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,720
- 小贱人 靴子  - 谁他妈的快来帮忙
- Little bitch! The boots! - Someone fucking help!

584
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,840
她的靴子
The boots!

585
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,160
靴子 贱人 婊子
- Look at the boots! Bitch! Whore! Martha, get up!

586
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,040
你看起来像个男人
You look like a man!

587
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,440

Right, get the fuck out of here, Martha!

588
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,480
穿靴子的臭婊子
The fucking boots bitch!

589
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,240
你他妈的就是个疯子
You're fucking insane!

590
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,440
- 才不是呢 - 闭嘴 听我说
- That isn't true! - Shut your fucking mouth and listen to me!

591
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,480
这世上就算有平行世界 也不会有任何一个我想要你 懂吗?
There isn't a fucking parallel world where I would want you, okay?

592
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,000
离我远一点 听见没?
So you stay away from me, do you hear?

593
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,680
哪怕你只是朝我的方向闻一下
If you so much as fucking sniff in my fucking direction,

594
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,400
我都会宰了你
I will see to your grave.

595
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,600
明白了吗?
Do you understand?

596
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,560
你他妈的明白了吗?
Do you fucking understand?!

597
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,680
明白了
I understand.

598
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,680
快他妈滚出我的生活
Now get the fuck out of my life.

599
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,120
麻烦让一让
Out of the fucking way, please.

600
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,040
