1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,480
一直以来 我都惊叹于 玛莎那不断刷新下限的能力
It always amazed me how Martha managed to surpass herself

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,840
她总能想出 各种变态的新花样来折磨我
with new and twisted ways of getting to me.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,440
但把我父母扯进来
But involving my parents,

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,760
跟他们说我车祸受伤 实在太过分了
telling them I'd been injured in a car crash, that was next level.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,840
走向那所房子时 我以为门背后等着我的
I expected a lot when I walked up to the house that day.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,000
会是一派兵荒马乱 爸妈也许在哭 而我得费力地解释这一切
A lot of panic. Crying, maybe. A hell of a lot of explaining.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,840
但我没想到的是
What I didn't expect, though,

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,440
一进门 却发现我爸正在跟她通话
was finding my dad on the phone to her when I walked in.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,480
我警告过你了 贱人 再给我打电话
I've told you, you bitch, you call me again,

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,720
我就去伦敦砍了你的两条腿
I'll come to London and cut your legs off.

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,920
对 你听见了 两条腿
Yeah, you heard. Your legs.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,440
哦? 是吗?
You will, will ya?

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,600
那我告诉你 没了腿 要想那么干可是难比登天
That's gonna be pretty fucking hard to do with no legs, let me tell you.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,040
她怎么会知道爸的手机号码?
How did she get his mobile?

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,400
是公司前台给她的 她谎称是你爸的客户
The receptionist at work gave it to her. Said she was a client.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,280
她昨天一整天 都在到处给你爸的同事打电话
You know she spent yesterday phoning round his colleagues,

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,400
说他是恋童癖 她小时候被他猥亵过
calling him a pedo, telling them he fiddled her when she was a child.

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,560
天啊
Christ.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,400
你这冒充律师的疯婆子 可真好意思说
Says the fucking mad bitch pretending to be a fucking lawyer!

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,360
人事部还为此找他谈话了
HR pulled him up on it too.

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,440
- 天哪 他是怎么回应的? - 你爸的脾气你也知道
- Jesus. How did he respond to that? - You know what your dad's like.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,000
他夸大其词地说外面停着一辆 他的小货车 里面装满了孩子
He doubled down on it. Told them he had a load of kids in a van outside.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,160
果然是他的风格
Of course he did.

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,880
再敢给我打电话 我就弄死你
You call me again, I'll make sure you breathe your last,

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,800
满嘴喷粪的臭婊子
you fucking cow of a cunt!

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,400
干得漂亮 问题解决了 我就不该费事来一趟
Well, that's sorted. Great work, Dad. I shouldn't have bothered coming up.

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,360
熊宝 她是谁?
Who is she, bear?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,600
是酒吧的一个客人 
Uh, she's this woman.

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,800
这段时间一直缠着我
She came into the pub, and she's been pestering me for some time.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,000
天哪 你辞职了吗?
Oh my God. Have you quit?

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,880
没有 因为辞职意味着认输
No, because that would mean she wins.

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,640
这不是输赢的问题 唐尼 事关你的安全呀 快辞职吧
It's not about winning, Donny. It's about your safety. Quit!

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,680
在你找到新工作之前 我们会资助你的 对吧 杰瑞?
We will sub you until you find a new job, won't we, Gerry?

35
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,720
我觉得这孩子说得对 这场仗我们不能输
I think the boy's right. It is about winning.

36
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,320
我的天哪
Oh, for goodness' sake.

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,640
听着 没事的 好吗?
Look, look, it's fine. Okay?

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,600
我已经报过案了 给警察打个电话 请他们来一趟
The police are aware of the situation, so give 'em a call, get 'em down here.

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,040
这一切很快就会结束的 我保证
It'll be over soon, all right? I promise.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,440
没事 我来接
It's all right. I'll get it.

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,320
是你吗 小驯鹿?
Is that you, reindeer?

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,240
{\an8}驯鹿宝贝

44
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,600
请喝茶
Here's your cup of tea.

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,120
谢谢
Thank you.

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,400
我了解到这是一桩骚扰案件
I understand this is a harassment case.

48
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
是的
That's right.

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,440
骚扰你们的人是谁?
And who is the person in question?

50
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,760
一个该死的贱人
She's a fucking bitch, that's who.

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,520
杰瑞 要不还是让我们来说吧
Tell you what, Gerry, why don't you let us handle this?

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,400
有需要的话我们会叫你
Uh, we'll call you if we need you.

54
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,440
这个女人已经跟踪我有一段时间了
Well, she's this woman, and she's been, like, stalking me for a while.

55
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,840
伦敦那边的警察 警告过她不准再骚扰我
I have this harassment warning out against her,

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
所以我想 她联系我父母的这个行为
so I assume now that she's contacted my parents,

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,400
应该构成骚扰了吧?
she's broken it, right?

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,240
严格来说 她没有骚扰你 她骚扰的是你父母
Technically, she's not harassing you. She's harassing your parents.

59
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,400
你在开玩笑吧?
You're kidding me?

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,200
如果你们想快刀斩乱麻
If you want a quick resolution,

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,200
最好的选择是让你父母 在苏格兰这边另行指控她
your parents would be best off making a separate allegation up here.

63
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,440
但这也太荒谬了
But that's ridiculous.

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,720
我知道听起来有些繁琐
I know it can feel convoluted,

65
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,560
但我们会尽力高效地
but, um, you know, we will do our very best to deal with the situation

66
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,080
解决眼下的问题
as, um, as effectively as possible.

67
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,480
不好意思 这笔好像坏了
Sorry, this pen's not working.

68
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,240
喔 瞧呀 原来是这么用的 抱歉
Oh, look. Sorry, there it is.

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,280
麻烦的小东西
One of those twisty ones.

70
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,760
那我们就开始吧?
Shall we begin?

71
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,320
我在苏格兰待了一个星期 等候警方采取行动
I spent a week in Scotland, waiting for the police to take action,

72
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,480
眼看着玛莎不停地来电骚扰
watching on as Martha kept calling.

73
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,280
又来找骂了 是吧?
Fucking come back for more, have you?

74
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,080
是 就知道你会这么说 该死的白痴
Aye, you would say that, you fucking imbecile.

75
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,680
见证着这一切对我爸妈造成的危害
Seeing the toll it was taking on my parents.

76
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,600
我爸因为吼叫而嗓音嘶哑
My dad's croaky voice from shouting.

77
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,880
能帮我倒点橙汁吗?
Could you pour me some orange juice?

78
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,480
无论我做什么 我妈都会温情夸赞
My mum forcing this sentiment onto everything I did.

79
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,600
你是个好孩子
You're a good boy.

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,160
所以没过多久 我就决定展开自救了
So it wasn't long before I decided to take action myself.

81
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,440
如果警察动作太慢 不能及时保护我们
I figured if the police were too slow to act, too slow to protect us,

82
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,040
那玛莎有可能做出更可怕的事情来
then Martha might do something worse.

83
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,800
是时候反客为主 掌握主动权了
It was time to take matters into my own hands.

84
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,320
玛莎
Martha.

85
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,320
离我的家人远一点
Leave my family alone.

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,040
- 我不知道你在说什么 驯鹿宝贝 - 别骚扰我的家人
- I don't know what you're talking about. - Leave my fucking family alone.

87
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,200
不然就永远别想跟我在一起了
If you don't, we will never be together.

88
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,440
明白吗?
Do you understand?

89
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,000
可是你报了警 我以为我们已经没可能了
I thought, with the police, we weren't on the cards anyway.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,920
闭嘴 安静听我说
Shut up. Be quiet for a second.

91
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,640
只要你不再骚扰我的家人...
If you leave my family alone...

92
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,640
我今晚就满足你的需求
I will hang your curtains tonight.

93
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,040
但我想确保准确无误地 满足你的全部需求
I wanna make sure I get it right though. All of it.

94
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,640
所以 给我写封邮件吧
So put it in an email.

95
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,280
告诉我你想对我做什么
What you want to do to me.

96
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,440
想让我怎么满足你
How you want me to... hang them.

97
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,080
但我喜欢粗暴的 好吗?
But I like it rough, okay?

98
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,360
所以内容越变态 越扭曲
So make sure it's as sick, twisted,

99
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,640
越丧心病狂越好 好吗?
as depraved as you can write it, yeah?

100
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,240
好的 小驯鹿
Oh yeah, reindeer.

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,040
好了
Okay.

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,480
{\an8}下流的小色鬼 偶要强上你 痛骂你、用尖利勿品捅穿你

103
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,560
{\an8}别想跑 我会用链子把你栓起来 惩罚你这淘气鬼

104
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,880

107
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,440
邓恩先生
Now, Mr. Dunn,

108
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,880
本次对话会全程录音
please note this interview is being recorded.

109
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
你并未被捕 随时可以自行离开
You are not under arrest, and you are free to leave at any point.

110
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,200
好的 谢谢
Okay. Um, thank you.

111
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,680
你也有权咨询独立法律意见 若你有此意愿的话
You're also entitled to independent legal advice, if you wish.

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,480
不 我觉得没那个必要
 no, I d... I don't think that's necessary.

114
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,640
既如此 事先申明 我已在问话前 将你的个人法律权利告知
In that case, please know this interview is being held under caution.

115
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,080
慢着 抱歉 现在这是什么情况?
Uh, wait. Sorry, what's going on?

116
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,000
你昨天在街上 跟玛莎·史考特见面了吗?
Did you meet Martha Scott in the street yesterday?

117
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,600
对 碰巧遇到的
Yeah, like, by chance.

118
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,120
你让她给你发送具有威胁性的 性骚扰邮件了吗?
Did you ask her to send you a sexually threatening email?

119
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,760
没有
No.

120
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
但我想确保准确无误地...
I wanna make sure I get it right.

121
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,440
满足你的全部需求 所以 给我写封邮件吧
All of it. So put it in an email.

122
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,200
告诉我你想对我做什么 想让我怎么满足你
What you want to do to me. How you want me to... hang them.

123
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,080
从头到尾 玛莎都有录音
Martha had taped everything.

124
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,280
- 我和你去野餐 - 天啊
- I'll picnic with you. - Oh my!

126
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,040
- 我们做过的一切 - 那我就满足你的需求
- Everything. - I'll hang your curtains.

127
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,000
那些关于"挂窗帘"和"满足需求"的隐喻
The curtain references. 

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,080
我对你是认真的
I'm serious about you.

129
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,520
那次我开玩笑说目光被她吸引
This one time I'd joked about checking her out.

130
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,600
我只是个普通男人呀 玛莎 拜托
Hey, I'm only human, Martha. Come on!

131
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,040
还有那次 我们调侃我阴茎的尺寸
This other time we laughed about my penis size.

132
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,600
- 我简直不敢相信自己的耳朵 - 25厘米哦 25厘米
- I couldn't believe what I was hearing. - Ten inches all round.

133
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,800
我记得这感觉 这种被当场戳穿 时间瞬间凝固
I remember that feeling, that caught red-handed, time-stood-still,

134
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,080
心态爆炸 血冲脑门 几欲发狂的感觉
bomb-in-a-war-zone, hot-fucking-flush madness.

135
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
她把一切全录下来了?
She's taped everything?

136
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,360
是不是全部 我无法断言
I can't speak for everything,

137
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,640
但她还给我们看了 一封你求她跟你肛交的邮件
but she also showed us an email from you soliciting for anal sex.

138
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,200
不 那是我一个损友用我邮箱发的
No, that was my fucking friend on my account.

139
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,960
他就是个白痴 发着玩的
He's... he's an idiot. He... he did it for a laugh.

140
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,080
她在骚扰我父母 我这么做只是想阻止她
She's... she's harassing my parents. I just... I just needed it to stop.

141
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,320
我同情你的处境 但也请配合我们警方的工作
I sympathize with your position, but you must allow us to do our job.

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
某种意义上 你的行为可以被视为诱人犯罪
In a certain light, this could be seen as entrapment.

143
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,080
但史考特女士并不想对你提出指控
But Ms. Scott does not wish to take any action against you.

144
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,120
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

145
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,160
史考特女士并不想对你提出指控
Ms. Scott does not wish to take any action against you.

146
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
指控我?
Against me?

147
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,800
什么鬼? 是她在跟踪我啊
What the hell? She's... she's... she's stalking me.

148
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,480
我建议你道歉
I suggest you apologize

149
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,240
以便警方以适当的方式进行工作
and let us go about doing our job again in the correct manner.

150
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,960
道歉? 对她? 你在跟我开玩笑吗?
Apologize? To her? Are you kidding me?

151
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,120
再说了 我要怎么道歉?
I mean, how would I even apologize?

152
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,960
我们可以替你转达歉意
We can pass along your apologies

153
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,360
然后强烈建议她 从今往后跟你各走各路
and then suggest to her, very strongly, that the two of you part ways.

154
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,160
警方不想再听到你们二人有任何纠葛
The police do not want to hear from either of you again.

155
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
你把我和她相提并论?
You're putting us on an even playing field?

156
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,640
所以呢?
Well?

157
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,920
跟她说我很抱歉
Tell her I'm sorry.

158
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,880
{\an8}警察杠杠来过了 哈哈

159
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,000
{\an8}那傻子说已后不想再官我们的事 让我俩各走各路

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,480
{\an8}哈哈哈 想得美 做梦 

161
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,960
{\an8}对了 窝一直都有录音

162
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,920
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,360
我忽然意识到
It suddenly dawned on me

164
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,760
这一切都是玛莎精心设计好的
that Martha knew exactly what she was doing.

165
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
如何在纠缠我的同时 逃避法律的制裁
Exactly how to get to me and still evade the law.

166
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,880
因为她已身经百战了
It's because she's been here countless times before.

167
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,720
她是一名惯犯 经验丰富的老手
She was a repeat offender. A seasoned pro.

168
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,480
我的跟踪狂是个经验丰富的老手
My stalker was a seasoned pro.

169
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,040
你怎么会这么蠢 唐尼? 居然想去陷害她?
How could you be so stupid, Donny? Framing her?

170
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,560
- 你在想什么呀? - 确实很蠢
- What the hell were you thinking? - I know. I know.

171
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,600
那女人袭击了我 唐尼
This woman attacked me, Donny.

172
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,720
现在我无论走到哪里都担心会撞见她
Everywhere I go, I'm worried I might bump into her.

173
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,440
而你却跟我说这辈子都甩不掉她了?
Now you're telling me I'm stuck with that for the rest of my life?

174
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,560
不用你说 我跟你一样苦恼 好吧?
You don't need to tell me. I feel the same way.

175
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,320
万一她找到我的推特页面
What if she finds my Twitter, Donny,

176
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,640
像那晚在酒吧时一样 胡说八道怎么办?
and starts spewing crap like she did in the pub that day?

177
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,480
或许你该暂时关闭社交帐号
Maybe you could take your socials down for a bit.

178
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,400
是吗 这就是你的建议?
Really? That's your suggestion?

179
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,840
至少删掉 所有跟彩虹族群有关的内容吧
Well, at the very least, get rid of all the rainbow unicorn stuff.

180
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,040
明哲保身
You know, protect yourself.

181
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,920
你是认真的吗? 这就是你的建议? 做个缩头乌龟
Are you serious? That's your recommendation? Hide myself.

182
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,960
如果你担心她大放厥词 就别给她抛诱饵
If you're worried about her opinions, don't give her the bait.

183
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,600
诱饵?
Bait?

184
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,040
拜托 泰瑞 我在努力想办法
Come on, Teri. I'm trying here.

185
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,360
在问题解决之前 稍微低调一点有什么不对?
What's wrong with having to lie low for a bit until this is all sorted?

186
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,560
因为那会剥夺我的灵魂
Because of what it takes from me.

187
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,560
你知道我有多不容易才走出来
Do you understand what it's like to get to a place in my life

188
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,680
展现真实的自己吗?
where I can even walk out the door?

189
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,120
现在你让我再走回去 把自己封闭起来 就因为你捅的篓子
And now I need to walk back in and bolt it shut, all because of you.

190
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,920
是因为我 还是因为某个变态在跟踪我?
Because of me or because some fucking psycho is stalking me?

191
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,080
因为你听起来像是 把这一切都怪在我头上了
Because just there it sounded like you were blaming me for all this.

192
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,600
她脑子有毛病 唐尼
She's mentally ill, Donny,

193
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
而你放任她胡来
and you indulged her.

194
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,840
拜托 亏你说得出口
Oh, please. Only you could make out

195
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,920
一个暴力跟踪狂正在摧毁我的生活
that having a violent stalker ruining my life

196
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,440
而这竟是我的错?
is somehow my fault.

197
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,320
你真想跟我聊这个话题?
You really wanna go there?

198
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,240
对 我倒真想听听你的高见
Yeah, I actually fucking do.

199
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,400
我认为你乐在其中
I think you love it.

200
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,240
我认为你在生活中 恰恰需要像她那样的人
I think it fits you perfectly having her in your life.

201
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,320
她眼中的你 正是你一心渴望成为的模样
Seeing you as the thing you try so hard to be.

202
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,560
她是你内心阴暗面的化身 是你一直压抑的
She's the embodiment of all your nasty repressions,

203
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,520
邪恶自我的映照
bottled up into one human being.

204
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
天啊 泰瑞 拜托
Jesus, Teri, come on.

205
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,960
你不能让她这样影响我们的感情
You can't let her affect us like this.

206
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,880
不是她在影响我们 是你自己
It's not her affecting us. It's you.

207
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
我不能再这样下去了
I can't be in this anymore.

208
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,200
我的生活不能这样 没完没了地混乱下去
I can't have this endless disorder in my life.

209
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,640
等一下
Hold on, hold on.

210
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,920
你要跟我分手吗? 就因为她?
Are you breaking up with me because of her?

211
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,200
不 是因为你
No. Because of you.

212
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,960
我知道跟泰瑞的感情结束了
I knew it was over with Teri.

213
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,760
转身离去的那一瞬间 她对我关闭了心门
She shut off her mind towards me the second she turned away.

214
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,600
曲终 人散
Done. Gone.

217
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,160
在跌入低谷的此刻
And now at rock bottom,

218
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,200
我所能找的唯一一丝慰藉
the only positive I could glean from the whole situation

219
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,560
就是情况已经不能变得更糟了
was that it couldn't get any worse from here.

220
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,080
不可能再有比这更糟的局面了
Surely it couldn't get any worse from here.

223
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,880
{\an8}总有一天偶们会在一起的 小驯鹿 只有你和我

224
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,480
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

225
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,160
- 你好 - 你好
- Yes, mate. - Hello.

226
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,760
- 麻烦给我来两杯这里的招牌啤酒 - 好的
- Can I get two pints of house, please? - Yeah, yeah.

227
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,800
不 你不能进来
No, you can't come in here.

228
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,600
- 你不能拦我 - 能 你被酒吧禁入了
- Can't stop me. - You're barred.

229
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,360
狄格西 去把格莱希叫来
Digsy, get Greggsy, will you?

230
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
- 他提早下班了 - 为什么?
- He's clocked off early. - Why?

231
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,240
去办点事 他要取货
Air strike, mate. He's picking up.

232
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,640
见鬼 那就去找吉诺
For fuck's sake. Get Gino.

233
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,680
- 也不行 - 为什么?
No can do. - Why?

234
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,480
- 天啊 - 那我就坐在这儿等着吧
- Oh my God. - I guess I'll sit here and wait, then.

235
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,440
不行 休想 我要报警了
No, you won't. I'll call the police.

236
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,520
报吧 看你能跟他们聊成什么样
Do it. See how far that gets you.

237
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,120
我记得他们说过 不想再管我们俩的事了
I heard they're washing their hands of the both of us.

238
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,200
- 打扰一下 我点的... - 请稍等 好吧?
- Excuse me, mate-- - In a minute, pal, all right?

239
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,160
狄格西 请她出去
Digsy, get her out of here.

240
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,200
- 来吧 女士 - 你他妈的别碰我
- Come on, missy. - Don't you fucking touch me!

241
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,120
你没有权利 没有任何权利碰我
You have no right. No right whatsoever.

242
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,280
现在我来月经了
Now, I'm on my period,

243
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,440
想进来喝杯水 这是我的权利
and I've come in for a glass of water, which is my right to do.

244
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,960
你不能否认一个经期女性 喝水的权力 那是违法的
You cannot deny a woman hydration when she's coming on. That is illegal.

245
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,080
随她去吧
Just fucking leave it, all right?

246
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,520
- 您想要点什么 女士?  - 别给她点餐 别理她
- What can I get you, madam? - Don't serve her, you prick. Ignore her.

247
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,600
见鬼 他们从哪儿把你找来的? 天啊
Fuck me. Where did they find you? Jesus.

248
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
去把酒水什么的放冰箱去
Go and stock the fridges or something.

249
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,800
- 抱歉... - 对 您要多少来着? 两杯?
I'm sorry... - Yeah. What was it? Two pints?

250
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,840
- 对 - 好的
Yeah. - Okay.

251
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,400
我建议你把那杯子擦干净
I'd wipe that glass clean if I were you.

252
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,840
上面全是阴道酵母菌
Fucking yeast fingers all over your pint.

253
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,040
你真该瞧瞧 他女朋友那风骚样儿 荡妇一个
You should see the woman he's with. His lady friend. Utter skank.

254
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,080
我们这儿都管他叫驼背佬 因为他爱弯着腰在臭水沟里找女人
We call him Hunchy around here 'cause of his gutter taste in women.

255
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,880
他就像那种贪吃松露的猪
He's like one of those hogs,

256
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,720
用他的脏鼻子闻来闻去寻找目标
always sniffling around for truffles with a shitty nose.

258
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,640
松露猪 这是你的新绰号
Truffles! That's your new nickname.

259
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,640
十英镑 劳驾
Tenner, please, mate.

260
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,120
- 谢谢 - 对了 他是个搞笑艺人
- Ta. - He's a comedian, by the way.

261
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
不太搞笑的那种
Not a very good one.

262
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,840
- 跟你在电视上看的不一样 - 给我们讲个笑话呗
- Not the kind of stuff you see on TV. - Tell us a joke, mate.

263
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,080
不 他不会讲笑话 他只会用道具
No, he doesn't do jokes, this one. It's more props.

264
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,320
贴着塑胶大眼睛的水壶之类的怪玩意
Googly eyes on kettles. Weird crap.

265
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,120
超级幼稚
Very immature.

266
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,800
- 你可以用谷歌搜索一下 - 搜什么关键词?
- You should Google it. - What do I Google?

267
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,360
- "垃圾 废物谐星" - "垃圾..."
- "Shite, two-bit comedian." - "Shite--"

268
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,800
不 我开玩笑的 但他实至名归
No, I... I'm joking. I'm joking. That's what it should be under.

269
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,280
试试搜索"唐尼·邓恩喜剧"
Try "Donny Dunn comedy."

270
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,120
"唐尼·邓恩喜剧"
"Donny Dunn comedy."

271
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,280
有了 搜到了
Oh yeah. Here it is.

272
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,880
你们喜欢听短笑话吗? 好啊 去看吉米·卡尔的表演吧
Do you like one-liners? Yeah. Check out Jimmy Carr.

273
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,400
- 天哪 老兄 你这是在搞笑吗?  - 我就说吧?
- Jesus, mate. Is that meant to be funny? - I know.

275
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,600
看看这个 好吧? 这边这个 简直是灾难
Watch this one, right? This one here. Lead balloon.

276
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,120
我有个女儿 现在两个月大
I've got a daughter. She's two months old.

277
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,520
我给她取名阿道夫 以此纪念希特勒
Called her Adolf after Adolf Hitler.

278
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,440
开玩笑的啦
I'm joking! I'm joking!

279
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,720
她已经满三个月了
She's three months old.

281
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,800
老兄 你讲笑话时 好像不该照着笔记本念吧?
Mate! I don't think you should be reading your jokes from your notepad, should you?

282
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,800
显然这是他表演的一部分 所谓的"反笑话"
It's part of the act, apparently. It's "anti-comedy," it's called.

283
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,520
- 一点也不好笑 - 可不是嘛
- Well, it's certainly that. - Yeah. That's so true.

284
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,720
我跟你说 老兄
I tell you what, mate.

285
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,000
你再用谷歌搜索些别的吧
Why don't you Google something else?

286
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,560
"连环跟踪狂 精神虐待律师的听障小孩"
"Serial stalker torments barrister's deaf child."

287
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,640
什么玩意 老兄?
What's that?

288
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,760
"连环跟踪狂精神虐待
"Serial stalker torments

289
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,840
律师的听障小孩"
barrister's deaf child."

290
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,960
你毁了我的好心情
You've ruined it!

291
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,920
你这该死的...
You fucking...

292
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,440
Oh fuck.

293
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
见鬼

294
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,320
全被你毁了 全毁了
You've ruined it! You fucking ruined it!

295
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,840
- 嘿 冷静 - 你胡说
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come on! - Your mouth!

296
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,440
你这张臭嘴
Your fucking mouth!

297
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,920
我警告过你 它会给你惹麻烦的 不是吗?
I warned you it'd get you in trouble, didn't I?

298
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,440
我警告过你
I warned you!

299
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,240
天哪 她怎么忽然发疯了?
Jesus! What the fuck was that about?

300
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,320
我给过她一杯茶
I gave her a cup of tea.

301
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,440
我只是给了她一杯茶而已
I gave her a cup of tea.

302
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,200
{\an8}写完介封邮件 我再也不想艮你扯上关系

303
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,640
{\an8}你切底惹毛我了

304
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,480
{\an8}你介个蠢货丑八怪 干着幼稚的行当

306
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,240
{\an8}被垃及父母养大 从垃及学校毕业的烂人

307
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,040
{\an8}我已经对你嘴下刘情了 我从不轻易恨人

308
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,000
{\an8}但你这次实在太出格子了

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,080
{\an8}或者太出格 反正有那么个说法

312
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,520
{\an8}你怎么不般回法夫去? 

313
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,160
{\an8}那里全是象你们一家介样的 懒汉、民族主义者、恋童癖和罪犯

314
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,760
{\an8}干吗来这里?  我们本来很开心 滚远点

315
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,520
{\an8}我认识的那些大人勿 都很看不惯你

316
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,440
{\an8}从我的ihpone发送

317
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,640
{\an8}对了 偶爱你 这点从未改变

318
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,840
{\an8}从我的iPhone发送

319
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,640
事情是这样的 老弟 
That's the thing, son.

320
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,120
你如果报警 酒吧老板会不高兴
If you call the police, the landlord is not gonna like that.

321
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,040
很不高兴
Not at all.

322
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,360
按道理 酒吧里应该一直有管理员盯着
We're supposed to have a manager on at all times.

323
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,480
而我们中途离开的事 不能被上头发现
The fact we just left you there, it's not good, man.

324
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,400
绝对不能
Not good.

325
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,800
也不能被上头发现我们把摄像头转开 
They find out we turn the cameras towards the walls

326
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,200
让客人在营业时间结束后继续喝酒
because of the lock-ins,

327
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,680
否则我们可能会因为失职而被炒鱿鱼
and that could be our jobs because that's negligence.

328
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,000
那是失职啊 唐尼
That's negligence, Donny.

329
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,240
要不这么着吧 我们回头去看你的表演 请你喝酒?
Hey, look. How about we come to your gig later and buy you a drink?

330
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,440
咱们好好喝一个
A nice big drink.

331
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,600
我们保证绝不会让她 
We'll make sure

332
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
再踏进这地方的方圆一公里之内
she doesn't come within a fucking mile of this place ever again.

333
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,240
好吧
Fine.

334
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,240
好
Fine.

338
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,200
你没事吧 兄弟?
You okay, bro?

356
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,400
- 嘿 你确定没问题吗? - 确定 我没事
- Hey, are you sure you're okay doing this? - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

357
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,560
是吗?
Yeah? 

358
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,040
那下一个就到你了 伙计
Well, you're up next, dude.

363
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,240
女士们先生们 准备好观看 本轮比赛的压轴好戏了吗?
Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for your final act of this section?

364
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,320
请保持这样的热情 欢迎唐尼·邓恩登场
Keep that noise going for Donny Dunn!

365
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,640
嘿 好的 谢谢大家 好 好了
Hey! All right! Thank you. Yes! All right.

366
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,440
我们开始吧
All right, here we go.

367
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,800
女士们先生们 我先把这话筒架拿开
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna get this out the way up top.

368
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,720
你们也许看出来了 我的脸上有点淤青和伤痕
You can probably tell my face is a little bruised and battered,

369
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,280
所以我要给大家一个忠告
so here's a piece of advice.

370
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,720
别在车上给人吹箫
Never give the blow job

371
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,600
尤其当你是开车的那一个
if you are the one driving.

372
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,600
好吧 那好
All right, good, good.

373
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,320
只是开场的一个温馨提示
Just a little reminder up top.

374
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,440
本场演出的赞助商是...
This set is brought to you by...

375
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,520
老爹避孕套 优质避孕套

376
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
套上优质避孕套
Pop a proper condom on.

377
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,960
非常感谢他们赞助这个节目
Thank you very much to them for sponsoring this routine.

378
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,200
好的 笑话时间到
Okay, let's do some jokes.

379
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,960
每次去海滩度假 我都不想戴墨镜
Whenever I go on holiday, uh, I never wanna wear sunglasses on the beach

380
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,240
怕有人会以为我在偷窥他们
in case people think I'm perving on them.

381
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,880
所以 为了打消这种疑虑
So to negate this worry,

382
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,520
我喜欢把眼睛放大
I actually like to widen my eyes.

383
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,680
诸位也有同感吧 这样我看起来就没那么变态了
I think you'll agree, it makes me look less creepy.

384
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,400
好吧 好的 那...
All right. Okay. So...

385
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,280

386

387
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,000

388
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,240
不好笑?
No?

389
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,520
好吧 行
All right. Yeah.

390
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,040
不合你们胃口 这笑话 好吧
Not for you, then, that one. Fine.

391
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,560
老爹安全套
Poppa Condoms.

392
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,320
适合爱吃汉堡王的警察朋友们
Proper condoms for policemen who like eating Burger King.

393
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,280
套上优质招牌皇堡警察专用套
Pop a proper Whopper copper condom on.

394
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,080
天哪
Oh boy.

396
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
见鬼 真是的...
fucking hell.

397
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,280
你看中的当然不是我的才华 当然不是了
Course you didn't see anything in it. Of course you didn't.

398
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
你只是看上了我
You only saw me.

399
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,240
我曾经以为 对...
I used to think, right...

400
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,560
真心以为 听我说 好吧?
Genuinely. Hear me out here, right?

402
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,320
我曾经以为
I used to think

403
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,400
我在这台上带给观众的
that what you're seeing here was, like,

404
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,600
是打破常规的新式幽默
breaking the mold.

405
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,760
我眼看着一个又一个搞笑艺人
You know, I'd watch these fucking other comics

406
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,080
取得我梦寐以求的成功 而我...
rising above me, and I... I just...

407
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,280
我完全想不通 为什么他们可以 我就不行
I never understood why... why them and not me.

408
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,200
可然后 啪
But then, bam!

409
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,080
现实给了我一记响亮的耳光
Reality smacks me in the face.

410
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,200
我太他妈天真了
I am so fucking naive.

411
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,960
我天真地以为自己 拥有独特的搞笑天赋
I was so naive in thinking that this was something special

412
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,280
以至于当一个编剧 假装为我的才华所倾倒
that when a writer sweeps you off your feet

413
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,680
说:"嘿 你很有才华 孩子 我来帮你成为巨星吧"
and says, "Hey, you've got it, kid. Let's make you famous..."

414
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,920
我居然对他说的每一个字深信不疑
you believe every word he's gonna say to you.

415
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,240
因为那是我这辈子都在渴望听到的话
'Cause it's the words you've wanted to hear your entire life.

416
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,280
"我相信你 正如你相信你自己"
"I believe in you... as much as you believe in yourself."

417
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,480
我对他言听计从
And you'll do just about anything in the world he asks of you

418
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,800
因为名望的光环会覆盖所有判断
because... because fame encompasses judgment, right?

419
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,040
我从小到大 一直害怕被人评判
And I... I feared judgment my entire life.

420
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,320
所以我渴望成名 因为一旦出名
That's why I wanted fame, because when you're famous,

421
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,960
在世人眼中 我就是一个名人
people see you as that, famous.

422
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,200
他们不会联想到 那些我害怕被贴上的标签
They're not thinking all the other things that I'm scared they're thinking.

423
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,040
比如"他就是个废物 他很无趣 他是个该死的基佬"之类的
Like, "That guy's a loser or a drip or a fucking faggot."

424
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,480
他们会想 "他是某某节目上的那家伙"
They think, "It's the guy from that thing."

425
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,800
"那家伙很有趣"
"It's the funny guy."

426
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,600
我做梦都想成为一个有趣的人
And I wanted so badly to be the funny guy.

427
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,400
去你妈的红灯 我就快说完了
Fuck your red light. I'm finishing.

428
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,920
所以当那个编剧说
So when this writer says

429
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,120
他只跟离经叛道的人合作 而我呢 为了直面自身的恐惧
he only works with wild ones, and to... to face my own fears, well,

430
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,160
没过多久 我就开始每周末都去他家 吸食成堆的药物
it's not long before I'm round his house, taking boatloads of drugs every weekend.

431
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,680
被诱奸是一件多么神奇的事情呀
And isn't getting groomed magical?

432
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,600
你还没搞清楚状况就被诱奸了
Before you realize you're actually getting groomed.

433
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,800
直到你被迷奸药药倒 躺在他家客厅的沙发上
Until you're passing out from GHB on his living-room couch,

434
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,520
而他用那双恶心的手扯开了你的裤子
while he tears at your trousers with his disgusting hands.

435
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,200
内心深处 你知道他让你做的那些事是错的
And you know it's wrong, deep down, what he's making you do.

436
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,240
但你仍旧不停地回去找他
But you just keep going back.

437
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,560
你会开始问自己
And you start to think,

438
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
"我就这么没自尊吗?
"Is my self-respect so fucking low,

439
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,680
我就这么渴望成功吗?
is my lust for success so fucking high,

440
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,120
以至于为了一点虚无缥缈的 成名的希望
that I will repeatedly go back to this man's house

441
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,960
一次又一次地送上门去
and let him abuse me

442
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,400
让他侵犯我?"
for a little peep at fame?"

443
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
"你是受害者 不要责怪自己"
"Oh, you're a victim. You mustn't blame yourself."

444
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,440
想法不错 但面对现实吧
Good sentiment, but let's be honest,

445
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,920
当你第四 第五次不省人事 醒来时发现阴茎被他含在嘴里
the fourth or fifth time you've passed out and woken up with your dick in his mouth,

446
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,800
你就该考虑别再回去了
you should probably think about not going back.

447
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,600
但我没有 我还是一往无前
But, no, I just had to keep going.

448
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,560
我非要上赶着去被强奸
I just had to get fucking raped.

449
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,880
想调侃我几句吗 伙计们?
Anything funny to say, boys?

450
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,920
我的自信心低到了极点...
My confidence is so low, right...

451
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,320
你们会喜欢这个后续的
You'll... you'll enjoy this.

452
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,200
...以至于我放任一个疯婆子 走进了我的生活
...that I let this fucking mad bitch into my life.

453
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,560
我在一间酒吧工作 有天我免费给了她一杯茶
I work in a bar, and I gave her this cup of tea on the house.

454
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,120
因为她当时在哭 我想安慰她
She... she was crying, and I wanted to cheer her up.

455
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,560
但她后来一次又一次地找上门
But she... she kept coming back in time and time again,

456
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,840
我明知道她越来越依恋我
and I... I knew she was growing attached,

457
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,560
却依然顺水推舟 只为了满足 我那渴望被关注的愚蠢心态
but I still went along with it to satisfy my own stupid need for attention.

458
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,640
于是我的脸成了这样 这是她干的
Hence the face. She... she did this to me.

459
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,880
瞧瞧
You see...

460
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,400
这就是性侵给人留下的印记
that's what abuse does to you, you know?

461
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
它把我变成了...
It made me this...

462
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,400
一块吸引生活中各种怪胎的磁石
sticking plaster for all of life's weirdos. This...

463
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,640
一个血淋淋的伤口 任他们嗅闻
This open wound for them to sniff at.

464
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,920
我知道她是个疯子 我知道她很危险
I knew she was mad, and I knew she was dangerous,

465
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,600
但她夸赞了我 那就足够了
but she flattered me, and that was enough.

466
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,600
而现在...我不知道怎样才能摆脱她
And now... I really don't know where it's gonna end.

467
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,560
这种情况也许会不死不休吧 而我不会杀人
I really think one of us is gonna have to die now, and I'm not a killer.

468
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,920
好啊 走吧 出去吧 下一轮演出会有很多俏皮话听
Yeah, go on, walk out. There'll be puns in the next section.

469
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,920
后台有个打扮成列车长的家伙
There's a guy dressed as a train conductor.

470
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,560
他的演出肯定很有趣
I'm sure that's gonna be funny.

471
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,240
我遇到了一个跨性别女性
I met this trans woman.

472
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,440
你们真该见见她
You should see her.

473
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,920
她是我这辈子见过的最美的人
She's the most beautiful person you've ever met, and

474
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,400
而我就是没办法...
I just couldn't...

475
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,040
我就是没办法
I just couldn't...

477
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,240
好好爱她
...love her.

478
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,400
我现在明白了
And I see it now.

479
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,280
我明白我为何会为她沦陷
I see what it was that I lost in her.

480
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,040
又为何会以那样的方式将一切搞砸
Moreover, I see why I messed it up in the way that I did.

481
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,960
我知道原因了
And it's because of this, right?

482
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,560
因为在这个世界上 我爱一样东西胜过爱她
It's because I loved one thing in this world more than I did her, right?

483
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,480
一样东西
One thing.

484
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,320
知道它是什么吗?
And do you know what that one thing was?

485
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,320
自我憎恨
Hating myself.

486
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
我超爱
I love it.

487
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,920
我上瘾了
I'm addicted to it.

488
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,320
除此之外我什么也不会
I don't know anything else.

489
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,760
因为我不能把握生命中的机会
Because God forbid ever taking a chance at life.

490
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,640
我不能把握得到幸福的机会
God forbid ever taking a chance at happiness.

491
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,720
所以我才搞砸了这段感情
And that's why I messed it up with her.

492
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,040
因为我对自己的痛恨 远胜于对她的爱
Because I hated myself so much more than I loved her.

493
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,120
而我非常 非常爱她
And I loved her so very much.

495
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,800
我这一辈子都在逃避
I've spent my whole life running away.

497
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,040
而这个...
And this...

498
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,120
这场比赛只是我漫长的人生马拉松里 又一段百米跑
This competition, this was just another hundred meters

499
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,640
这场马拉松 我是没法活着完成了
in a marathon I was never gonna finish alive.

500
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,640
所以我现在不想跑了
So I'm gonna stop running now.

501
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,200
因为我已经筋疲力尽 跑不动了
Because I just don't have the legs for it anymore. I just don't.

503
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
好吧
Yeah.

505
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,920
老实说 我也不知道 为什么一口气说了这么多
Don't know how I started coming out with all this, to be honest.

506
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,320
真不知道该怎么收尾
Really not sure how to finish.

507
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,160
哦 对了...
Oh, actually...

508
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,720
老爹避孕套 优质避孕套 
Poppa condoms, proper condoms

509
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,600
专为在直升机上工作
for policemen working in helicopters

510
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,680
喜欢吃印度菜 和汉堡王的警察朋友量身打造
who enjoy eating Indian food and Burger King.

512
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,800
套上优质招牌皇堡 直升机警察炸薄饼专用避孕套
Pop a proper Whopper chopper copper popadam condom on.

513
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,880
有人想问问题吗?
Are there any questions?

514
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,080
好吧 那么
Well, then,

515
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,800
我很期待赢得这场比赛
I look forward to winning this competition.

517
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,280
