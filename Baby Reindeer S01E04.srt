00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
{\an8}本集内容包含性暴力描述

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,960
{\an8}也许会令一些观众感到不适

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,320
六个月
Six months.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,280
我过了六个月才举报玛莎
It had taken me six months to report Martha.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,320
需要帮忙吗?
Can I help you?

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,080
我应该从昨天
I should have started with Teri,

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,800
玛莎攻击泰瑞的事说起 但我没有
how Martha attacked her just yesterday, but I didn't.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,280
我想报案 流程是怎样的?
I would like to report something. How does it work?

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,880
你想报什么案?
What would you like to report?

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,840
我该提及她捏我下体的事 但我没有
I should have mentioned the grope, but I didn't.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,840
我不知道该怎么跟你说 但我被人跟踪了
I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm, like... I'm getting stalked.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,800
- 男人还是女人? - 一个女人
- By a man or a woman? - A woman.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
我该提起她的名字 那些报道 还有她的前科
I should have mentioned her name, the articles, her previous crimes,

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,040
但我偏偏没有
but I just didn't.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,560
听着 我真的很担心
Look, I'm... I'm really worried here.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,200
我觉得她需要帮助
I think she needs help.

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,360
- 当警察问起... - 你为什么现在才来报案?
- And when the policeman asked... - Why'd it take you so long to report it?

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,080
...那段回忆如潮水般翻涌而至
...it all just came flooding back.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,160
{\an8}驯鹿宝贝

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,520
大约五年前 我去参加了爱丁堡国际艺穗节
About five years earlier, I went to the Edinburgh Festival.

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,360
我一直梦想在那里演出
It was always an ambition of mine to take a show there,

22
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,280
走上喧嚣的街头 跟其他表演者和艺人一样
to join the hustle and bustle of street performers and artists

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,680
盼望能幸运地一举成名
gambling their luck on a shot at fame.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,280
我知道终有一天 我会来碰碰运气
I knew I had to come here one day and take a chance myself.

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,200
写作 表演 喜剧 任何创作形式都可以
Writing, acting, comedy, whatever it took.

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,920
我所追求的自由洒脱的生活
I just needed the kind of freedom in life

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,880
唯有通过 敢于做梦 勇敢追梦才能实现
which only comes from dreaming big and stopping at nothing to get there.

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,680
{\an8}啤酒花酒吧

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,120
所以当我抵达位于城郊的表演场地
So as I arrived at my venue on the outskirts of town

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,680
即便一进门就注意到了 肮脏的窗户 黏糊的地板
and noticed the grubby windows, the sticky floors,

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,720
还有空气中洋溢的炸薯条的油脂味
the smell of chip fat as I walked in...

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,280
我依然满怀憧憬和期待
it felt like everything to me.

34
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,480
- 你好 - 好
- Hello. - Yo.

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,080
请问喜剧表演厅怎么走?
Can you let me know where to go for the comedy?

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,760
演员还是观众?
Performer or punter?

37
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
演员
Performer.

38
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,120
那边的门
Door over there.

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,720
谢谢
Thank you.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,480
{\an8}艺穗节

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,720
你指的是另一扇门还是...
Do you mean, like, a different door, or...

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,360
角落有插孔 把话筒插上 餐桌推到一边就好
Plug it in in the corner. Shove the table to the side.

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,480
什么? 这就是我的舞台? 就在这儿? 在酒吧大厅里?
What? This is my stage? Here? In with the main bar?

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
没错
That's right.

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,800
电视会一直开着吗?
I mean, do the televisions stay on?

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,440
我们会调成静音
We mute.

47
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,800
- 那些客人呢? - 你要想的话 可以请他们离开
- And the punters? - You can ask them to leave if you'd like.

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,240
不 那我可做不出来
Oh no, I couldn't do that.

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,720
他们是这里的常客 而我只来一个月
They're here 12 months a year. I'm only here one.

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,040
你能请他们离开吗?
Can you ask them to leave?

51
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,480
不能
No.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,960
话说 他们对搞笑表演有兴趣吗?
I mean, do they even wanna see comedy?

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,120
只有一个办法可以知道
Only one way to find out.

54
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,600
好的 那我们就快开始吧 对
All right. We'd better begin. Yeah.

55
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,600
搞什么啊
Come on!

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,000
该死的爱丁堡艺穗节
Fucking Edinburgh Fringe!

57
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,280
女士们先生们 大家好 欢迎观看我的搞笑表演
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the comedy.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,280
我会在这堵墙后面换演出服
Uh, I'm gonna go behind that little wall there and change.

60
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,040
待会儿我一喊 大家就热情欢迎我上台
When I shout out, you all go mad and welcome me to the stage.

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,080
听起来怎么样?
How does that sound?

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,160
好极了 有一位回应我
Great. One person.

64
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,960
好的 那我们开始吧
All right, here goes.

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,720
女士们先生们 请以热烈的掌声 欢迎
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage

66
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,160
唐尼·邓恩上台
Donny Dunn!

68
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,040
好耶 让我听到你们的尖叫
Fucking yes! Let me hear ya! Whoo!

69
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,720
话说我妈今天去世了
So my mum died today.

70
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,840
不是吧? 没反应?
Really? Nothing?

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,720
我妈才刚去世 我就以那种方式 作为演出的开场 不好笑吗?
You see, it's funny opening a show like that when my mum has just died, no?

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,200
对照修辞法?
Antithesis?

73
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,120
表演结果一塌糊涂
The shows were just awful.

74
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,040
大多数时候 我不得不因为没有观众而取消表演
Most days, I had to cancel due to nobody turning up.

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,800
还有一次 我被开单身派对的人
One time, I had to end the show early

76
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,080
当成了戏弄的对象 只好提早结束演出
when I was caught in the crosshairs of a stag do.

77
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,560
- 还给我 嘿  - 来拿呀
- Give that! Hey, hey! - Here!

78
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,480
哎呀 糟了
No, no!

79
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,320
别闹了 拜托  我之后的表演还要用呢
No, please! I need that for the rest of the month.

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,960
有时候我会光站着不发传单
Some days, I stood not handing out any flyers

82
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,560
暗自希望这样就不会有人来
in the hope nobody would come.

83
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,560
才刚表演一个星期 我已经感觉自己是演艺界的垃圾了
I was about a week in, and I felt like the dregs of show business.

84
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,680
我前几天刚割了包皮 好不容易才找到足够大的剪刀
Got circumcised the other day. Just had to find scissors big enough.

85
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,440
懂我的意思吗?
Do you know what I mean? Yeah?

86
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,680
我在说我的鸡鸡很大
I'm saying I got a big cock.

87
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,040
没反应? 不好笑? 不是吧? 好吧 没关系
Nothing? No? Really? Okay. That's fine.

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,680
有天我去商店买茄子 结果带回了这个
Went to the shops for some eggplant. Came back with this.

90
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,960
见鬼 老板真觉得我好糊弄是吧?
Bloody hell! He saw me coming, didn't he?

91
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,440
对吧? 把蛋粘在盆栽上 跟我说这是小茄子
Yeah? He's just taped some eggs to a plant.

93
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,800
我怀疑就算我提早收拾行李回家了 都不会有人注意到
I questioned if I went home, whether anyone would notice,

94
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,360
更不会有人在意
whether anyone would care.

95
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,560
好了 女士们先生们 表演结束
All right, ladies and gentlemen, that's the show!

98
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,960
我会拿着小桶站在门边
I'm gonna be standing by the door

99
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,360
大家认为这场表演值多少钱 就请随意打赏
with a bucket for your donations. Give what you think the show is worth.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,080
感谢前来
Thanks for coming.

101
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,000
感谢前来
Thanks for coming.

102
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,640
感谢前来
Thanks for coming.

103
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
- 扎心了 - 至少比昨天有进步
- Ouch. - Better than yesterday, I suppose.

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,200
昨天收获了什么?
What was yesterday?

105
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,360
一颗扣子和一个避孕套
- A button and a condom.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,480
来 我有东西给你
Here, I've got something for you.

107
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,440
不知道从谁钱包里掉出来的
Fell out of someone's wallet last night.

108
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,000
你想要就拿去吧 我知道 你们这些艺术家可喜欢相互吹捧了
It's yours if you want it. I know how much you artistes love to schmooze.

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,440
{\an8}爱丁堡艺穗节 2011

110
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,400
{\an8}露娜酒吧 贵宾会员酒吧

111
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,400
我们在拍摄时完全没想到它会成功
We had no idea it would ever work when we shot it.

112
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
你知道那个有很多锡罐兵的场景吗?
You know the, uh, the scene with the tin-can soldiers?

113
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,520
那是在兰卡斯特的一个沙滩上拍的 我们往演员身上裹了餐饮锡箔纸
We shot that on a beach in Lancaster using tinfoil from catering.

114
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,880
裹得太多 以至于班吉说 他感觉自己的补牙填充物都快脱落了
We used so much that Benji said he could feel his fillings coming out.

115
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,960
不好意思 抱歉打扰了 你参与了《棉口蛇》的制作吗?
Uh, excuse me. Sorry to interrupt, but did you work on Cotton Mouth?

116
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,640
- 对 - 天哪 我超爱那部剧
- Yeah. - Oh my God, I fucking love that show.

117
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,760
- 你负责做什么? - 我是编剧组的
- What did you do on it? - I was on the writing staff.

118
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,880
天哪 我可以膜拜你吗?
Holy shit, do I kiss your feet now?

120
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,080
话说 我最近在啤酒花酒吧演出
Um, look, I'm doing this show up at the Hoppy bar.

121
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,640
有空来看看吧
Come down and see it if you can.

123
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,440
- "《大笑至死》" - 对 这标题很妙吧?
- "LOL on Cancer." - Yeah. Yeah, it's a great title, isn't it?

124
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,400
我们尽量找机会去
We'll try.

125
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,240
你们有看到不错的表演吗?
You guys seen anything decent?

126
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,560
- 回头见 - 好
See you later. - Yeah.

127
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,080
可恶
Fuck.

128
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,160
真是自负的混蛋
Wankers, aren't they?

129
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,080
是啊 但我给人的第一印象也很糟
Yeah, terrible first impression on my part though.

130
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,760
真糟糕 你以后别想在影视圈混了
Shocking. You'll never work in the industry again.

131
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,920
目前为止都还没混过呢
Chance would be a fine thing.

132
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,280
- 看见那边那个人了吗? - 嗯
- See that guy over there? - Yeah.

133
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,160
他是《绵口蛇》的编剧 那部剧特别棒 你看过吗?
He wrote Cotton Mouth. It's fucking amazing. Have you seen it?

134
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,560
- 零星看过一点 不是我的菜 - 那你肯定是疯了
- Bits and bobs. Not my thing. - Then you're mental.

135
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,800
这么年轻就那么成功 简直违法嘛
Should be illegal for people to be that young and that successful.

136
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,000
想在他的酒里下毒吗?
Wanna slip poison in his drink?

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,680
天哪 这想法真阴暗
Wow, that's dark.

138
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,840
不过 好呀
But yes.

139
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,000
- 但话说回来 节目成功还是全靠演员 - 完全赞同
- Anyway, the actors made that show. - Couldn't agree more.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,400
天哪 我真恨我自己 那么在乎他的看法
Man, I hate that I care about his opinion.

141
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,040
你是干什么的?
What do you do?

142
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,560
观众笑了 我就是搞笑艺人 观众没笑 我就是行为艺术家
Uh, I'm a comedian when they laugh, a performance artist when they don't.

143
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,280
- 那今晚如何? - 今晚我是行为艺术家
- How were they tonight? - They came for the art.

145
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,520
- 对了 我叫唐尼 - 达瑞安·奥康纳
- Um, I'm Donny, by the way. - Darrien O'Connor.

146
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,720
是那个...
Uh, as in...

147
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
《绵口蛇》的编剧
Cotton Mouth.

148
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,600
- 什么? 可刚才那是... - 我的助手
- What? But... But then who's-- - My writing assistant.

149
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,040
但以后不是了 因为我发现他冒用我的头衔
Former writing assistant, now I know he's stealing my job.

150
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,720
真抱歉 先前我说"全靠演员" 是开玩笑的
I'm so sorry. All that actor stuff was merely banter.

151
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,320
我知道你的实力 出色的剧本才是那部剧的精髓
I knew who you were. The writing was the best bit about that show.

152
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,400
- 别担心 没事 - 见鬼...
- Don't worry. Fu...

153
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,440
- 可你刚说不喜欢那部剧 - 确实不喜欢
- You just said you didn't like it. - I don't.

154
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
那你为什么要写自己不喜欢的剧?
Why would you do a show that you don't like?

155
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,800
因为我是影视界的妓女 来者不拒
I'm a televisual prostitute. I'll take whatever anyone gives me.

156
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,960
那么失败的搞笑艺人呢?
Well, how about a failing comedian?

158
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,760
女士们先生们 请热烈欢迎
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage

159
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,800
那个正在服用 抗焦虑药物的搞笑男人上台...
the man who puts the LOL in propranolol...

160
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,360
麻烦后期把这段剪掉
We'll probably cut that bit.

161
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,480
...唐尼·邓恩
...Donny Dunn!

166
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,680
话说我妈今天去世了
So my mum died today.

167
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,840
这大概正是她希望看到的吧
I guess this is what she would've wanted. 

168
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,200
我尬死在台上 下去陪她
Me to die with her.

170
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,760
谁想见见我的朋友珀西?
Um, who wants to meet my friend Percy?

171
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,280
好
Yeah

172
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,840
好的 好 那好
All right. Yeah, okay.

173
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,200
这是珀西 我们是腹语双人组
This is Percy. We're a ventriloquist double act.

174
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,520
嗨 珀西 你好吗?
Hi, Percy, how are you?

175
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,720
我很好 谢谢 你呢?
I'm good, thanks. You?

176
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,880
你今天在忙什么 珀西?
What have you been up to today, Percy?

177
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,160
给人吹箫
Sucking cock.

178
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,040
哇 真慷慨 谢谢
Oh, wow, great. Thank you.

179
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
太棒了
Oh, cool!

180
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,240
- 感谢前来 - 再见
- Thanks for coming. - Cheers.

181
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,160
非常感谢
Appreciate that.

182
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,760
- 天哪 20英镑的钞票 - 昨晚有人忘了说再见
- Jesus, a 20. - I didn't get a goodbye last night.

183
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,360
- 所以我想着让他今天补回来 - 对哦 那好 再见
- So I thought I'd come get it now. - Oh, right. Well, uh, goodbye.

185
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,280
不 等等 我开玩笑的 对不起
No. No, wait. I'm joking. Sorry.

186
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,080
你很奇怪
You're strange.

187
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,160
是吗? 见鬼
Am I? Shit.

188
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,040
别担心 我不介意 怪就怪呗
Don't worry. I don't mind a bit of strange.

189
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,000
我们谈谈吧 我可以给你些建议 把表演打磨得更上一层楼
Let's talk. Might have a few pointers how to take this show to the next level.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,680
哇 好 那太好了 好的
Wow. Yeah. I mean... I mean, that would be great, yeah.

191
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,920
- 那就回头见了 - 对 回头见 老兄
- Laters, then. - Yeah. Laters, uh, cowboy.

192
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,960
我在胡说什么啊?
What the fuck?

193
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,840
接下来的几周 达瑞安指导了我的演出
Darrien became involved in the show for the next few weeks,

194
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,640
为我提供建议 哪些内容好笑、哪些不好笑
giving me advice on bits that were and weren't working.

195
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,520
...而且要保持眼神交流
...and maintain eye contact.

196
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,320
花各种时间排练 把演出打磨成型
Rehearsing all kinds of hours to whip everything into shape.

197
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,680
看着我
Look at me.

198
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,920
前面摆三排
Three rows across the front.

199
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,200
很快 酒吧里的电视被关掉 观众席也面向了正确的位置
Soon the televisions were shut off and the chairs faced the right way.

200
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,920
连工作人员也开始往外赶 询问何时播放球赛的客人
Even the bar staff dismissed customers who dared to ask when the football was on.

201
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,880
不 今天不播放球赛 去路那边的酒吧试试吧
No, we're not showing it today. Try the pub down the road.

202
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,040
节目一下子火爆了起来
And the shows just flourished.

203
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,840
女士们先生们 现在有请我们的表演者
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage

204
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,880
唐尼·邓恩上台
Donny Dunn!

205
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,520
话说我妈今天去世了
So my mum died today.

206
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,560
对 这大概正是她希望看到的吧
Yeah, I suppose this is what she would have wanted.

207
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,720
我尬死在台上 下去陪她
Me to die with her.

208
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,560
每天晚上 我都会跟达瑞安
Every night, I would go out with Darrien

209
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
去城里最大的私人会员酒吧聚会 过着名流般的生活
and live life like a celebrity in the main private members' bar in town,

210
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,160
喝一整晚的鸡尾酒 滔滔不绝地谈论我的表演
drinking cocktails until the early hours, talking endlessly about the show

211
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,600
以及艺穗节结束后的打算
and what we were gonna do with it when the festival was over.

212
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,080
我们得把你的演出搬上伦敦的舞台
We need to get you performing this show in London.

213
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,880
达瑞安跟我以往遇到的人都不同
Darrien was like no one I'd ever met before.

214
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,960
他自称是...
A self-prescribed...

215
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,080
佛教徒 追求开放式恋爱的泛性恋 对高品质奢华生活有独特品位
Buddhist, polyamorous pansexual with a taste for the finer things in life.

216
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,480
才认识不到两周 他就让我大开眼界
Within two weeks of knowing him, he'd opened my eyes

217
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,920
我从来不知道 这个世界是如此精彩刺激
to the kind of excitement I didn't even know existed.

218
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,160
被拴在暖气片上 嘴里塞着情趣口塞
It's hard to yell for help chained to a radiator

219
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,720
真的很难张嘴喊救命
with a ball gag in your mouth.

220
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,160
我们坐在那家私人会员酒吧里 探讨各种深刻的话题
And as we sat in that private members' bar and put the world to rights,

221
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,760
我感觉自己迎来了一股变迁之风
I felt like I was gliding on the winds of change.

222
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,680
仿佛这个男人在我眼前晃动着 一把通往新天地的钥匙
Like this man was dangling some keys to a secret club,

223
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,560
而我只需要握住他的手 接受他的指引
and all I needed to do was take his hand and let him guide me.

224
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,080
我们来这里做什么?
What are we doing in here?

226
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
厕所有人巡逻
They patrol the toilets. - Oh.

227
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,000
你以后和我一起写剧本吧
We need to get you writing scripts with me.

228
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,800
好啊 那太棒了
Yeah. That would be amazing, yeah.

229
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,520
- 你准备好了吗? - 做什么都行
- Are you ready? - Ready for anything, yeah.

230
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,920
很好 给
Good. Here.

231
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,800
天哪
Fuck.

232
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,160
好孩子
Good lad.

233
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,840
但好景不长
But all good things come to an end.

234
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,480
你们要是觉得这发网难看 我之前喝醉酒
If you think that's bad, I was so drunk,

235
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,680
还把它套在了阴茎上呢
I ended up putting the hairnet on my penis.

236
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
达瑞安提早回了伦敦
Darrien went back to London early,

237
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,400
直到艺穗节结束 都没再联系过我
and I didn't hear from him for the rest of the festival.

238
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,600
也许他去哪里休息或者度假了
Maybe he was taking a break or on holiday somewhere,

239
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,840
但我却有种奇怪的感觉
but it felt strange.

240
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,320
随着传单被扔到一边 海报被撤下
And as the flyers got binned and the posters came down,

241
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,360
电视重新打开 开始播放球赛
the televisions came back on and the football started to play,

242
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,040
我不禁怀疑那一切是否只是黄粱一梦
I questioned whether it was some crazy dream.

243
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
它究竟是否真实发生过
Whether it even happened at all.

244
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,960
就是这样
That's it.

245
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,240
体会火焰在血管中流动的感觉
Feel like fire flowing through your veins.

246
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,960
让身体尽情随之舞动
Let it take you where it takes you.

247
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,120
接下来的几个月 我去上了牛津的表演学院
In the months that followed, I went to acting school in Oxford.

248
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,920
还记得当初收到录取通知时 我差点喜极而泣
I remember when I got in, I almost broke down crying with happiness.

249
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,560
但在经历了爱丁堡的那一切之后
But following everything that had happened in Edinburgh

250
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,240
除了有幸在此遇见琪莉
and despite meeting Keeley,

251
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,800
回归学习生活感觉就像走了一步错棋
going back to a life of learning seemed like a misstep.

252
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,920
我穿着体操服练习跳舞 假装自己是一簇火焰...
And as I pranced around in a leotard, pretending to be fire...

253
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,760
做发声练习...
or doing vocal warm-ups...

254
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,480
模仿各种动物
...or mimicking animals

255
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,040
学了各种乱七八糟的事 就是没真正学到表演
and basically doing anything other than fucking acting,

256
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,520
内心滋生出一种难以言喻的感觉
I felt one of those impossible-to-articulate feelings

257
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,480
令我不安
in my stomach.

258
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,960
我想念达瑞安
I missed Darrien.

259
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,640
想念他带给我的勇气 他让我感觉自己不再是个边缘人
I missed the confidence he gave me, the feeling of relevancy,

260
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,640
他给了我希望 让我相信有朝一日 我能够有所成就
of hope that one day my life might actually lead somewhere.

261
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,400
而现在 我被淹没在黑色的人群中 犹如沧海一粟
Now, a body in a sea of black, I felt like a nobody again,

262
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,840
我才刚初尝世界的精彩 就再次变回了一个无名小卒
like I was shrinking from the world just as I developed a taste for it.

263
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,240
唐尼
Donny.

264
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,680
来吗?
Coming?

265
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,120
好
Yeah.

266
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,640
{\an8}达瑞安

267
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,000
抱歉 我得接个电话
I'm sorry, I gotta take this.

268
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,800
你还好吗 伙计?对
All right, mate? Yeah.

269
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,640
很高兴接到你的电话
No, it's great to hear from you.

270
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,440
对 不 我很喜欢 我还挺享受的
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm... I'm... I'm loving it. I'm really enjoying myself.

272
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,760
那个 我们能换个时间再聊吗? 其实我现在正在上课
Um, look, is there a better time to chat? I'm actually in class right now.

273
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,200
什么? 你是认真的吗? 你想跟我一起写剧本?
What? Are you serious? You want me to write with you?

274
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,840
好啊 伙计 我一百个愿意 当然好了...
I mean, yes, mate. A thousand yeses. Of course. I mean--

275
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,800
唐尼 你在搞什么啊? 老师快气炸了
Donny, what are you playing at? She's fucking raging in there.

276
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,360
好 我马上回去
Yeah, I'll be two seconds, okay? I'll be two seconds.

277
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,120
我得先挂了 但是好的 就这么定了
Look, I've gotta go, but yes, 100%.

278
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,360
唐尼·布拉斯科
Donnie Brasco.

279
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,520
希妮德·奥康娜
Sinéad O'Connor.

280
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,640
很高兴再见到你 一切还好吗?
It's good to see you. You all right?

281
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,120
好着呢 进来吧
Yeah. Come in.

282
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,160
谢谢 好
Thanks, yeah.

283
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,600
哇 这地方真不错
Wow, this place is amazing.

284
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,280
天啊 你养了只猫
Oh, wow, you've got a cat.

285
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,000
弗格斯 我们非常相爱
Fergus. We're very much in love.

286
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,280
我毫不意外
I'm not surprised.

287
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,120
你真是个可爱的小家伙 对吧 弗格斯? 你好呀 伙计
You're a lovely little fella, aren't you, Fergus? Hello, mate.

288
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,000
要不要喝杯茶?
Cup of tea?

289
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,680
好的 其实我写了几场戏
Okay, so I've actually written up a few scenes and stuff.

291
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,960
随便写的 尚待改进
Um, nothing major. Still needs a bit of work.

292
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,200
好吧
All right.

293
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,840
有60页呢
Sixty pages.

294
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,600
对 没花多少时间
Yeah, didn't take long.

295
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,600
这样吧
I tell you what.

296
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,880
你来给我介绍故事梗概 正好练习一下推销自己的作品
Why don't you give me the gist? Be a good lesson in pitching.

297
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,000
好吧 故事的主人翁 是一个名叫奈吉尔的人
Okay, well, it's about this guy called Nigel,

298
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,040
他是个非常成功的律师 在50岁那年
a high-flying lawyer who decides, at the age of 50,

299
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,240
他决定尝试职业摔跤
to try his hand at professional wrestling.

300
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,320
这个题材很小众
That's quite niche.

301
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,520
是吗?
Really?

302
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,000
对 除了六岁小孩 谁还会看摔跤啊?
Yeah. Who watches wrestling anymore who's above the age of six?

303
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,080
是啊 不 反正我不看
Yeah, no. Not me anyway.

304
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,040
继续吧
Continue.

305
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,200
总之 基本上就是 他忽然爱上了摔跤 然后越来越投入
Anyway, basically, he gets the bug, and he starts wrestling more and more.

306
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,520
很快他就难以维持 工作和爱好之间的平衡
Soon he is struggling to keep the balance between his two worlds.

307
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,840
他开始顶着被打得青紫的眼圈出庭
He starts, like, turning up to court cases with black eyes,

308
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,760
有时候他忘记卸妆就去...
or he... he's forgotten to take his makeup off and, um...

309
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,520
所以他必须做出抉择
Well, so he has this choice to make.

310
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,160
是以律师的身份生活下去
Live his life as a lawyer

311
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,480
还是做刽子手哈利
or Hangman Harry,

312
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,760
那个来自德州奥斯汀 脚踏污泥 豪饮啤酒的酒馆狂野拳击手
the mud-stompin', beer-swillin', bar-room brawler from Austin, Texas.

313
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,400
刽子手哈利是他给自己取的名号
Hangman Harry is his wrestling name.

314
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,000
仍需打磨
Needs more work.

315
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,000
可你还没看过呢
Oh, but you... you haven't read it.

316
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,720
等你说动我了 我会看的
I'll read it when you sell it to me.

317
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,360
我可以去另一个房间 试着...
I could sit in another room and try-- 

318
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,720
你想嗑药吗?
Do you wanna get high?

319
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,160
- 在这里? - 对 有何不可呢?
- What, here? Yeah, why not?

320
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,600
晚点我们还可以出去喝一杯 就像在爱丁堡时一样
We can go out and grab a drink later. Be like Edinburgh all over again.

321
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,120
好啊
Yeah, sure.

322
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,160
天哪 你和一些喜剧界的传奇人物合作过啊
Holy shit, you've worked with some comedy legends.

323
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,840
- 他们怎么样? - 一般般
- What are they like? - Average.

324
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,600
开什么玩笑? 他们都超厉害的
No, you can't mean that. They're amazing.

325
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,120
其中有几个还在我 "社交晚宴最想邀请的人"里排前五呢
I mean, some of them would be in my top five dinner-party guests for sure.

326
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,200
你玩过那个游戏吗?
Ever played that game?

327
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,560
你可以邀请任何人来吃晚餐 但只能选五个人
You can invite anyone you want for dinner, but you can only pick five.

329
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,000
听起来很糟糕 我的家是一个神圣的地方
Ugh, sounds horrible. My home's a sacred space.

330
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,960
只有很特别的人才能来
Takes someone very special to be allowed in.

331
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,560
拜托 别回避问题 你会选哪五个人?
Come on, that's a cop-out answer. Who would they be?

332
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,360
我不会选名人
Well, they wouldn't be celebrities.

333
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,160
只会选领袖人物 宗教大师 这类灵性觉醒的人
They'd be leaders, gurus, spiritually awake.

334
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,800
或者干脆就好几个不同版本的我
That, or me around each place.

336
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,400
太扯...六个你一起开派对 天哪 我都能想象你们会嗑多少药了
Six of you at one party. Jesus, I can imagine how many drugs there'd be.

337
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,640
告诉你我的人选吧
I'll tell you mine.

338
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,320
热维斯 萨莎·拜伦·科恩 茱莉亚·戴维斯
Gervais, Sacha Baron Cohen, Julia Davis,

339
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,760
库根或者普赖尔 再加上一个圣雄甘地之类的人
Coogan or Pryor, and, I don't know, Gandhi or someone

340
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
来彰显我品德高尚
because you need to look virtuous.

341
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,280
- 你还想再爽一点吗? - 好啊
- Do you wanna get really high? - Fuck yeah.

342
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,840
不 我是指会爽翻天那种
No, like, really high.

343
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,680
来吧
Fuck yeah.

344
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,560
- 对了 他们的秘诀是什么? - 什么意思?
- What was their secret, by the way? What do you mean?

345
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,720
他们是如何取得今天的成就的?
What did they all do to get where they are today?

346
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,840
他们听我的话
Listen to me.

347
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,720
没跟你开玩笑
I'm serious.

348
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,200
对于我的所有要求 他们都全情投入
They threw themselves into everything I asked of them.

349
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,720
哇 真了不起
Wow, that's... that's awesome.

350
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,880
过来 坐到我旁边
Here. Come sit next to me.

351
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,880
这都是些什么?
What's all this?

352
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,080
这是莫利
This is a bomb of MDMA.

353
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,400
这是液态摇头丸 一种松弛剂
And this is GHB. It's a relaxant.

354
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
- 它能让你放松 - 好
- It relaxes you. - Yeah.

355
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,760
相信我 这会是你前所未有的经历
Trust me. You haven't experienced anything like it.

356
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,080
遇见你就是我前所未有的经历 这点毋庸置疑
I haven't experienced anything like you, that's for sure.

357
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,640
见鬼 好恶心
Fucking hell. That's disgusting.

358
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,320
有付出才有收获嘛
Little pain for a little gain.

359
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,560
第一次嗑嗨真的是前所未有的体验
The first time I came up was like nothing I'd ever experienced.

360
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,360
仿佛有一束圣光从天而降
It felt like a beam of divine light shone down from space,

361
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,760
穿透达瑞安家的屋顶 照进客厅
through Darrien's roof and into his living room,

362
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,280
将我瞬间笼罩
exactly where I was sitting,

363
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,560
那光芒如同印度洋温暖的海浪 冲刷着我的身体
as warm Indian Ocean waves passed up and down my body.

364
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,640
靠在那张沙发上 达瑞安说我的才华
And on that couch, Darrien spoke about my talents

365
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,080
毫不逊色于我崇拜的任何喜剧巨匠
in the same vein as all my comedy heroes growing up.

366
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,120
你是个很有前途的年轻人
You've got a big future ahead of you.

367
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,160
前途无量
A very big future.

368
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,760
他的每一句话和我吸入的每一口药物
With every sentence he said and every drug I took,

369
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,200
都令我对此深信不疑 我仿佛能够闻到 甚至尝到
I started to believe it, smell it,

370
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,240
成功的喜悦
taste it, even.

371
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,480
我的梦想化作了一幅画卷
That my dreams were quantifiable.

372
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,600
在我眼前徐徐展开 是那样的触手可及
That I could almost grasp them as they untangled before me.

373
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,720
别再浪费时间等待了
No time to wait around.

374
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,520
你不介意吧?
You don't mind, do you?

375
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
不介意
No.

376
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
见鬼
Oh shit.

377
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,520
怎么了?
What?

378
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,520
你怎么了?
What's wrong?

380
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
我想吐
I think I'm gonna puke.

381
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,480
不 别吐在猫碗里
No. Not in the cat bowl.

382
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,840
你还好吧?
You okay?

383
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,840
我给你拍拍背
Let me pat your back. - Oh, 

384
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,000
谢谢 真不好意思
thank you. I'm so sorry.

385
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,200
天啊 真对不起
Oh God. I'm so sorry.

386
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,160
住手
Stop!

387
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,040
喝杏仁奶可以吗?
Will almond milk do?

388
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,000
给 喝下去就舒服多了
There you go. That'll sort you out.

389
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,720
刚才的事 我很抱歉
I'm really sorry about that.

390
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,840
没关系 下次我们慢慢来
It's okay. We'll go slower next time.

391
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,080
我真想假装一切到那晚就结束了
I would love to pretend that's as far as it went.

392
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,760
{\an8}达瑞安来电

393
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,640
嘿 伙计 最近怎么样?
Hey, mate. How's it going?

394
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,840
对 不 我很好
Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm good.

395
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,280
我要去上课了 所以如果...
Look, I'm about to go into class, so if it--

396
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,960
什么?
What?

397
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,680
什么?那个电视台 读了《刽子手哈利》?
What? The channel have Hangman Harry?

398
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,120
天哪 他们喜欢吗? 那真是...
Holy shit. They love it? That's fucking...

399
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,160
是啊 太不可思议了 我...
Yeah, yeah, that... that's incredible. I...

400
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,560
喔 你想让我...
Oh, you want me to--

401
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,120
对 不 有道理
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, that makes sense.

402
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,840
是啊 不 当然 好的 我一定来
Yeah. No, sure, yeah. I'll come.

403
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,240
- 这是天大的机会呀 - 是啊 太棒了 谢谢你
- That's huge. - Yeah. That's great. Thank you.

404
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,600
在职业生涯初期 就能得到主流频道的支持
To have a massive channel backing you this early in your career.

405
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,960
达瑞安向我阐述电视台的反馈时
Darrien took me through everything the channel said,

406
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,320
我笑得合不拢嘴
and I beamed from ear to ear

407
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,800
他讲到了整季剧本的佣金 期权协议的时限
as he spoke of series commissions and option periods

408
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,360
还有一大堆不明觉厉的概念
and all these fabulous things I didn't understand,

409
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,800
以至于当他把药物拿出来时 我毫不犹豫地就吃了
that by the time he cracked out the drugs, I said yes without hesitation.

410
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,800
我还以为我搞砸了
I thought I'd blown it, you know.

411
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,480
搞砸什么?
What?

412
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,400
这一切
This.

413
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
我上回吐的时候
When I threw up.

414
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
别傻了
Don't be silly.

415
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,400
只是吐了一下 还不至于让我弃置你的才华
It'd take a lot more than vomit for me to be put off with your talents.

416
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,480
谢谢你
Thank you.

417
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,680
真的很感谢
Thank you so much.

418
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,520
如果有什么我能做的...
If there's anything I can do...

419
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,120
只要...坚持梦想就好
Just... keep dreaming.

421
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,680
这个简单
That's easy.

422
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,280
跟琪莉一起搬到伦敦后
After I'd moved to London with Keeley,

423
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,560
我几乎每个周末都会去达瑞安家嗑药
I started taking drugs at Darrien's house almost every weekend.

424
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,720
来 我们照例从莫利开始
Here. We'll start off with the usual MDMA.

425
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,280
我盲目地相信着他许下的承诺
I had fully drunk the Kool-Aid of his promises,

426
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,920
相信着成功指日可待
of believing that success was right around the corner.

427
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,680
我会在30岁前拥有属于自己的节目
That I would have my own show by 30.

428
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,840
除此之外 还会成为百万富翁
A millionaire around the same time.

429
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,200
我对他所说的深信不疑
All stuff he said to me

430
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,520
任由他把最新的化学品送到我嘴里
before he spoon-fed me the latest chemical.

431
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,440
只偶尔吸食过大麻的我 已然演变成
I went from a guy who had smoked a bit of weed

432
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,560
整周沉迷于毒品 吸食霹雳可卡因...
to week-long benders, high on crack.

433
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,600
别害怕 追逐无与伦比的快感
Chase the high. Don't be scared.

434
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,560
...还有冰毒...
And meth.

435
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,600
你会充分发挥自己的创造潜能
You'll embrace your creative potential.

436
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,920
...和海洛因
And heroin.

437
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,480
你会大有作为的
You're going places.

438
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,400
吸食了足够多的药物 你会进入一种状态
When you take enough to reach that plane

439
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,400
所有思绪停止 快感侵袭而至
where all thought stops and euphoria begins,

440
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,680
那些关于 未来 名利和幸福的高谈阔论
talk of the future and fame and happiness

441
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,960
变得无比真实 正如此刻体内流动着的种种化学品
feel almost as real as the chemicals that flow through your body.

442
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,760
毫无疑问 如今在我看来 成功只是时间问题
It was only a matter of time now, surely.

443
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,920
有很多次 我都在他眼前昏睡过去
I passed out many times in his company.

444
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,960
通常醒来时 都会发现他躺在我旁边
I would often wake to find him lying next to me,

445
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,560
而他的手和嘴 探索着我各个不同的身体部位
his hands and mouth in various places as he searched around my body.

446
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,320
当我跌跌撞撞地走向浴室 会发现下体上凝结着
I would stumble to the bathroom and find his putrid spit

448
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,280
他散发出腐臭味的呕吐物
congealed around my genital area.

449
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,240
然后每到周一 他又会变回那个冷酷严苛的指导者
Then every Monday he was back to his cold, callous self,

450
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,040
毫不留情地批判我的剧本 让我重写 不付酬劳
giving me brutal script notes and making me do overnight rewrites

451
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,760
不顾及我的药劲仍未消退
on a comedown, for no money,

452
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,320
以及最近因为咽喉感染而一直咳嗽
while I coughed up my latest throat infection.

453
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,280
但我仍会回去找他
And still I went back.

454
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,920
- 你不陪我过生日吗? - 不 我跟你说了要去达瑞安家
- You're not spending my birthday with me? - No, I'm going round Darrien's.

455
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,840
搞什么啊 唐尼? 你不觉得这样有点奇怪吗?
What the hell, Donny? Is this not a little bit strange to you?

456
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,520
我不想跟你的朋友一起出去玩 开销太大了
I don't wanna go away with your friends. I can't fucking afford it.

457
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,520
所以你就跑去一个编剧大叔家里嗑药
So instead you're going to an old writer's house to take drugs.

458
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,600
我知道这在你看来很荒谬 但他在帮我开展事业
I know it doesn't make sense to you. But he's helping me with my career.

459
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,560
他帮了你什么? 你搬来伦敦后就一直在酒吧打工
What's he done? You've worked in a bar since you came to London.

460
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,240
- 还有免费给他做事 - 我没时间跟你谈这个
- You do everything for him for free. - I don't have time for this conversation.

461
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,560
那天晚上 达瑞安给我准备了迷幻药
That night, Darrien presented me with acid.

462
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,000
我吃半根 剩下的一根半归你
I'll take half of one. You take one and a half.

463
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
放心吧 之后我会引导你
I'll act as your guide so you feel safe.

464
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,360
诀窍就是让身心随着音乐律动
Let the music take you where it wants to.

465
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,520
有时候 当别人问我
I sometimes think back to this image,

466
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,640
"你是怎么走上喜剧这条路的?"
me, mid-twenties, sitting high as a kite,

467
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,240
我会回想起这个画面
watching this 55-year-old man

468
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,600
二十多岁的我 坐在那里飘飘欲仙
dancing this odd Amazonian jig in front of me,

469
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,040
看这个55岁的男人
when somebody asks me the question,

470
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,320
在我面前跳古怪的亚马逊舞蹈
"How did you get into comedy?"

471
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,320
继续描述你看见了什么
Keep telling me what you're seeing.

472
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,800
缤纷摇曳的色彩 似乎...描绘着什么形状
Shimmering colors. The... outline of something.

473
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,560
所以我现在是凤凰了?
So I'm a phoenix right now?

474
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,960
你看到的是这样吗?
Is that what you're seeing?

475
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,600
你得把我视为某种强大的个体
It's important that you see me as something strong.

476
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,360
一只凤凰 一位骑士
A phoenix. A knight.

477
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,960
或者某个你喜欢的摔跤手
Maybe one of those wrestlers that you like.

478
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,200
忽然间 没来由地
Suddenly, seemingly from nowhere,

479
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,520
一个清晰 强烈的念头 在我的脑海浮现
this clear, strong thought entered my head.

480
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,480
-"他在试图操控你的思想" - 怎么了?
-"He's trying to control your mind." - What's wrong?

481
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,120
"这个男人很坏 这个情况很糟 快逃"
"This man is bad. This situation is bad. Get out now."

482
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,520
可恶
Fuck!

483
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,880
- 见鬼  - 怎么了? 
- Fuck! - What's the matter?

484
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,800
你不舒服吗?
What's wrong?

485
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,640
我看不见了 眼前只有白茫茫一片
I can't see. All I can see is white.

486
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,680
没事 你正在重生
It's fine. It's fine. It's rebirth.

487
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,800
- 我看不见 我他妈看不见了 - 有我在 你很安全
- I can't see. I can't fucking see. - You're safe with me.

488
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,400
这段时间一直被我压抑的潜意识
My subconscious, that I'd been repressing this entire time,

489
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,480
终于跳出来向我揭示了现状的不堪
had reared its head to shine the most obvious light on a fucked-up situation.

490
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,960
你怎么了?
What's happening to you?

491
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,000
- 这很糟糕 我听见有人说这很糟糕 - 那是你的幻觉
- This is bad. I'm being told this is bad. - It's paranoia.

492
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,120
- 对抗它 - 关掉音乐
- Fight against it. - Turn the music off.

493
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,240
已经关掉了
It's off, it's off.

494
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,280
见鬼
Agh, fuck!

495
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,160
见鬼
Fuck!

496
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,840
该死
Oh fuck!

498
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,440
这该死的... 天哪 这该死的音乐
The fucking... Oh God! The fucking music!

500
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,400
可恶
Agh, fuck!

501
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,920
把这个喝了
Have this.

502
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,200
- 不要 - 会有助于缓解不适
- No. - It'll help take the edge off.

503
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,960
你以前喝过的 它能帮你放松
You've had it before. It relaxes you.

504
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,960
不 尽量别吐出来
No. No, try to keep it in.

505
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,280
吞下去
Swallow. Swallow.

506
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,200
很好
That's good. That's good.

507
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,360
药劲太强了
That was strong! That was strong!

508
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,840
好了
Okay. Okay.

509
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
好了
There.

510
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,080
对着我的手呼气 调整呼吸
Breathe into my hand. Breathe.

511
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,440
没事的 
It's okay.

512
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,360
这是必经的过程
It's okay. This is part of it.

513
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
都是过程而已
It's all part of it.

516
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,320
放松
Relax.

517
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,480
放轻松
Relax.

518
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,200
没事的
It's fine.

520
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
不
No.

521
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,120
不要
No.

522
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,120
昨晚感觉如何?
How'd you find it?

523
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,000
你该去冲个澡 用温水清洗一下对你有好处
You should shower. A wash in warm water will do you good.

525
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
见鬼
Fuck!

526
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,280
我能进来吗?
Can I come in?

527
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,280
过来
Come here.

528
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,120
我很想说我一走了之了
I would love to say I left.

529
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,280
我夺门而出 再也没回去 但其实在那之后 我又逗留了数日
That I stormed out and never went back. But I stayed for days afterwards.

530
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
事实上 周一我的眼睛感染发炎
In fact, come Monday, I got an eye infection

531
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,440
于是躺在他家地板上 让他用盐水帮我洗眼睛
and lay on his floor as he bathed it in salt water.

532
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,560
到了周二 他忙着接电话时 我就帮他喂猫
On Tuesday, I fed his cat while he took phone calls.

533
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,960
直到周三 我终于回家了
On Wednesday, I finally went home.

534
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,800
嘿 你怎么啦?
Hey, what's wrong?

535
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,440
没什么 就是之前 跟你闹得不欢而散 太难过了
Oh, nothing. I just feel bad for how we left things.

536
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,960
最让我在意的就是那些未知
What bothered me most was the not knowing.

537
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,440
在我昏睡不醒的期间都发生了什么?
What happened all those moments I passed out?

538
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

539
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,240
我没事 对
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah.

540
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,560
过往种种 是他真心认为我有才华 还是一场精心策划的操控?
Did he ever believe in me, or was this whole thing preplanned manipulation?

541
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,280
他从头到尾都是清醒的吗?
Was he sober the entire time?

542
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,200
那么做对他有什么好处? 仅仅出于使人堕落的欲望吗?
And what was he getting from it? Was it simply a desire to corrupt?

543
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,600
为了满足他病态的心理 实现某种目标?
To achieve whatever his sick mind wanted to achieve?

544
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,040
摧毁我的生活会让他性致勃发?
Was that the turn-on, to ruin my life?

545
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,960
要不我们去看电视吧? 我找不到感觉
Uh, look, do you wanna watch something instead? I'm... I'm not feeling it.

546
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,160
不要 闭嘴
No, shut up.

547
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,600
对不起 今天恐怕是不行了
I... I... I'm sorry. It's... it's... it's just not happening today.

548
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,360
- 昨天也是这样 - 也许我需要一段冷静期
- It didn't happen yesterday either. - Maybe I need to take a break from it all.

549
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,120
你指的是做爱还是我们的关系?
What? A break from sex or from me?

550
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,240
天哪
Wow.

551
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,160
好吧
Okay.

552
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,800
琪莉搬走后 我陷入了崩溃
After Keeley moved out, I fell to pieces.

553
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,840
我能做的就只剩下审视那段回忆
Now all that was left to do was stare at the memory of what happened.

554
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,520
我开始对自己的性倾向感到困惑 那种困惑
I started to feel this overwhelming sexual confusion

555
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,880
如潮水般将我淹没
crashing through my body.

556
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,200
我以为它会自行退去 但它却演变成了不自信
I thought it might pass, but it became an insecurity,

557
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,680
在我的内心不断蔓延 直至疯狂肆虐
which grew into a raging madness within me.

558
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,200
我无从分辨这些感受是因他而起
I could never tell whether these feelings were because of him

559
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,800
还是一直以来 隐藏在我内心深处的真实
or whether they always existed deep down.

560
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,040
是我在无意间散发出的某种气质 导致了那一切的发生
Did it all happen because I was giving off some vibe I wasn't aware of?

561
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,760
还是那一切的发生 导致我变成了这样?
Or did what happen make me this way?

562
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,080
我走在街上 会感觉所有人都在看我
I would feel like everyone who looked at me

563
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,920
他们能看穿我经历的一切
could see what I was going through.

564
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,840
仿佛他们在窥探我的灵魂时
Like they were peering into my soul,

565
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,280
看见了我被性侵的经历 以及我的怀疑和困惑
seeing the rape and the doubts and the confusion.

566
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,680
好像我的双眼是两扇窗户
Like my eyes were these windows

567
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,160
透过它们能看见我人生中 隐藏最深的秘密
onto the most tightly-held secret of my life.

568
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,240
我会幻想自己杀死他
I would dream of killing him,

569
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,200
切掉他的阴茎或者割了他的舌头 怎样杀伤力最大就怎么来
chopping his cock off or his tongue out, whichever had done me the most damage,

570
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,800
然后把他的尸体烧成灰烬
and burning his body to the ground.

571
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,480
于是 在历经数月的 仇恨 愤怒和困惑之后
So after months of hate and anger and confusion,

572
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,080
我已经别无选择
I was left with no choice.

573
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,120
{\an8}极端性爱

575
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,840
见鬼
fuck.

576
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,360
我很快就高潮了
I orgasmed quickly,

577
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,200
快到我再也无法否认 我的性取向发生了转变
in such a way that there was no denying my desires were shifting.

578
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,240
我每天都会情不自禁地打开电脑
Every day, the laptop called me to it.

579
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,160
我感到无比地困惑和恼怒
I felt confused. I felt angry.

580
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,960
就如同重新经历了一次青春期
I felt like I was going through puberty all over again.

581
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,160
好的 来吧
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

582
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,760
我开始跟不同性别的人乱搞
I started having reckless sex with people of all genders

583
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,800
绝望地追寻着真相
in this desperate pursuit of the truth.

584
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,880
我将自己置于淫乱不堪的境地 甚至甘冒再次被强暴的风险
I would put myself in fucked-up situations where I'd almost risk being raped again

585
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,320
试图理解当初被侵犯的来龙去脉
in this attempt to understand the first time.

586
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,240
若我像个男妓一样被人轮番取乐
Like if I'm passed around like a whore,

587
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,400
或许我至少能说服自己 不去在乎这具躯体
then I might at least shed this idea that my body is part of me somehow.

588
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,560
谁在乎以前发生过什么呀?
Like who cares if it happened before?

589
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,280
如今那种事已上演了无数次 过往如何根本无关紧要
It's happened a ton of times now, so what does it matter?

590
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,080
但其实它很重要
But it mattered.

591
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,280
它很重要 因为这一切正是他想要的
It mattered because this is what he wanted.

592
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,680
这正是一直以来他眼中的我
This is what he saw in me all along.

593
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,720
一种苦涩的感觉涌上心头 令我如鲠在喉
Then a feeling so bitter I could almost catch it in my throat.

594
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,160
那就是事实似乎证明了他是对的
That he'd been vindicated somehow.

595
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,600
我犹如一头困兽
Now I was stuck,

596
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,240
被一群混迹酒吧的 厌女的异性恋正统主义者包围
surrounded by pilsner misogynists so heteronormative

597
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,480
除了寻求他们的认同 我什么也做不了
I could do nothing but crave their approval.

599
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,600
那天恰好碰上前所未有的暴风雨
It was the stormiest weather.

600
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,160
我去过马略卡岛很多次 它真的很美
So many times I've been to Mallorca. It's beautiful.

601
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,800
如果你购买全包套餐 就可以...
You can have these all-inclusive things where you just...

602
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,240
一切都是免费的 全部
Everything is for free. Like, everything.

603
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,600
我同时跟十几个人约会和交往
Dates and relationships by the dozen.

604
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,280
这一切都源自于那次最黑暗的经历
All of which started off in the gutter of what happened.

605
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,200
...但我还是想坚持采用...
...but I think I'm gonna stick with...

606
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,680
我对恋爱没兴趣 我已经失去了爱人的能力
I wasn't interested in love. I had no capacity for it anymore.

607
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,280
我只期望这些人能带给我答案
I just wanted these people to provide fucking answers.

608
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,800
你知道吗? 在马略卡岛 他们会问你想不想做水上韵律操
You know in Mallorca, when they ask if you want to do aqua aerobics?

609
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,040
其实没必要不停问我的...
You don't need to ask me five million times--

610
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,840
不好意思 抱歉 我得去趟洗手间
Excuse me, sorry. Can I... I'm just gonna nip to the bathroom.

611
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,600
我去去就回 好吗?
I'll be right back, yeah?

613
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,640
但我又抛弃和疏远了他们每一个人
As I spurned and alienated every single one of them.

614
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,080
你可以来个360度急转弯 在车轮的刺耳摩擦声中绝尘而去
You could do a 360, screech around the place, just zoom off.

616
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,680
现在很多人都回归胶片拍摄了
A lot of people, they've gone back to shooting film now.

618
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,720
但我还是想坚持采用数码拍摄
I think I'm just gonna stick to digital.

619
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
直到我遇见了...
Until I met...

622
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,600
嘿
Hey.

623
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,720
你真人比视频里更帅
You're cuter in person than you are online.

624
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,760
老实说 有好几次我跟人线下约会
Honestly, some of the dates I've been on,

625
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,840
来赴约那些家伙居然 比个人资料照片上的老了15岁
the guys turn up 15 years older than their profile picture.

626
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,400
她具备我梦寐以求的一切 拥有我欠缺的所有素质
She was everything I wanted. Everything I needed.

628
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,320
聪颖 风趣 自信 坚强
Smart, funny, confident, strong.

629
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,760
今晚跟我回家吧
Come back with me tonight.

630
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,920
可每当她握住我的手或者凝望我时
But with every hand-hold or lingering stare

631
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,200
一股强烈的愤怒和羞愧感 就会席卷而至
came a crushing sense of anger and shame

632
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,680
因为我爱上了她
that I was falling in love with her,

633
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,880
我不能再继续隐姓埋名了
that I couldn't hide in anonymity anymore.

634
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,160
只是别告诉托尼
Just don't tell Tony.

636
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,200
也许最令我痛苦的是
And, perhaps most bitter of all,

637
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,600
若非因为那个人的所作所为 我可能根本不会爱上她
that I might not feel this way if he hadn't done what he did.

638
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,240
但当玛莎出现时
But when Martha turned up,

639
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,480
那些困惑逐渐淡去...
all that confusion faded...

640
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,000
她似乎不费吹灰之力地
as she reached, seemingly without effort,

641
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,240
就触及了我内心最不安的角落 然后用光明驱散了黑暗
into the darkest pockets of my insecurity and turned them to light.

642
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,000
你这样完美的骨相简直违法嘛
Should be illegal to have your bone structure too.

643
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,280
他们真该向你收税 男人税
They should tax you for it. Man tax.

644
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,080
玛莎眼中的我 正是我内心渴望成为的样子
Martha saw me the way I wanted to be seen.

646
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,200
所以在走进警局的那一刻
So when it came to the point of going to the police,

647
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,680
我实在无法忍受自己要举报的 是玛莎而不是他 这是何其讽刺啊
I just couldn't stand the irony of reporting her but not him.

648
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,200
需要帮忙吗?
Can I help you?

649
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,280
我总感觉她其实是病了 她身不由己
There was always a sense that she was ill, that she couldn't help it,

650
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,280
而那个男人才是 极端恶劣 擅长思想控制的诱奸犯
whereas he was a pernicious, manipulative groomer.

651
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,880
承认被她侵犯就得承认被他侵犯
To admit to her was to admit to him.

652
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,760
而我还没对任何人坦白过那段经历
And I hadn't admitted him to anyone yet.

653
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,960
- 所以当警察问起... - 你为什么现在才来报案?
- So when the policeman asked... - Why'd it take you so long to report it?

654
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,680
我不知道
I don't know.

655
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,440
你先回家吧 去查看她的邮件
Go home, look through her emails,

656
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,200
找到有特别意义的内容再回来
and when you find something of significance, come back.

657
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,560
在那之前 除非出现有说服力的证据
Until then, unless we see some proper evidence,

658
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,960
否则我们爱莫能助
there's nothing we can do.

659
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,720
在那一刻 我又回到了原点
And with that, I was back to square one.

661
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,880
